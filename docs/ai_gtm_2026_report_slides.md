## The state of AI for GTM in 2026.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

We've entered the **have and have not era of AI in go-to-market (GTM)**. 53% of leaders we surveyed in the State of B2B GTM report (N=195) said they're seeing little or no impact from AI. Many GTM leaders frankly don't trust AI outputs and are worried about AI slop.

Yet a **small group of GTM leaders are seeing outsized returns from AI**. They're generating high quality pipeline on auto-pilot. They're improving conversion rates through 1:1 messaging. And they're seeing big efficiency gains across marketing and sales.

We **interviewed 30 GTM experts who are already seeing big gains from AI, and compiled more than 40 of their best AI use cases**. The use cases spanned across four categories: content creation, growth and product marketing, prospecting, and sales engagement.

---

The best news: **you don't need to be an AI engineer to replicate these AI use cases yourself**. Most of them can be built with general-purpose LLMs (ex: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) along with affordable, off-the-shelf tools. (Of course, you could always make these use cases more advanced if you'd like!)

**This report is here to help inspire you and teach you how to adopt AI for GTM**. We've included real-life prompts and step-by-step workflows that are working for your peers. Give them a try and let us know what you think!

## AI content assistant

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Maja Voje**, GTM Strategist
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

One of the favorite workflows for the companies I work with is building their own AI Content Assistant that helps more of their team members get active on LinkedIn.

**How to use it:** Help you ideate, draft, and edit content.

**Step 1: Create a new Project in your ChatGPT account.**
- Upload key files to the project like your messaging or brand guidelines, knowledge base (all key descriptions of your company/product), and examples of your best-performing content.

**Step 2: Write detailed project instructions on how to help you with content.**
- Define your voice, “do”s and “don't”s.
- Example: `In this project, you will help me write LinkedIn content for [name] - he/she is [short bio and key fields of expertise]. Create strong hooks, avoid overused buzzwords, and don't use hashtags.`

**Step 3: Define the voice, if needed, or add some examples.**
- Example: `You can use content from the attached files to refer to our services.`

## AI content idea generator

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Maja Voje**, GTM Strategist
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

One of my best hacks for content comes from call transcripts. We drop lots of great ideas there, and I don't want them to go to waste.

**Step 1: Upload a transcript of the call to ChatGPT.**
**Step 2: Ask it to analyze the key themes that could be turned into a post, blog, or similar.**

Your task: Extract 10 distinct, high-signal themes or insights expressed by [Name] that could be turned into strong LinkedIn thought-leadership posts. For each theme, provide:
1. Theme title (short, sharp, scroll-stopping)
2. Core insight (1-2 sentences explaining the idea in plain English)
3. Why this resonates on LinkedIn (tie it to a real pain, misconception, or trend)
4. Suggested post angle (e.g. contrarian take, personal story, framework, warning, tactical breakdown)

Constraints:
- Focus on applied, opinionated insights, not generic summaries
- Prioritize ideas that spark discussion, disagreement, or “that's so true” reactions
- Write for [target audience, e.g. B2B founders / GTM leaders / operators]
- Avoid fluff, quotes without context, or surface-level themes

## AI outlines from primary sources

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Gail Axelrod**, Jellyfish
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

One of my go-to workflows for writing content starts with a primary source, usually a recorded call transcript, which I'll drop into ChatGPT as the initial input. From there, I'll ask ChatGPT to surface the main highlights of the conversation to help me build an outline. I think of these bullets as the headers for any resulting content piece. What used to take hours – combing through a 20 page transcript for instance – can now be done in seconds. It saves a ton of time and helps me focus on the most interesting aspects of any call.

For prompting, I'll usually start with what I know to be the main takeaways of the conversation and ask ChatGPT to surface details around those points. It produces a very workable outline to write from and helps me get more done each week.

Is this groundbreaking? No. Is it efficient and useful? Definitely. The real key is starting with excellent source material. If your inputs are vague or generic, you'll get the same in return. But if the transcript is rich, specific, and unique, ChatGPT does a great job surfacing what's most important and providing a strong outline to work from and expand upon.

Here's a sample prompt:

`Go through this transcript and pull out the key highlights of the conversation, add sub sections for each of the main points. Be sure to include any relevant quotes from each speaker [list speaker names for ChatGPT to identify], add time stamps for clarity. Leave placeholders for an introduction, conclusion and call to action.`

Another fun use case I've found for ChatGPT is to brainstorm headline options, article titles and email subject lines. Sometimes the results are hilariously bad, but I usually end up with a few workable options. ChatGPT is great at taking very specific directions like character counts or word limits and putting them into action. And as an internal team of one, ChatGPT is like my little assistant.

## AI content strategist

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Amos Bar-Joseph**, Swan
**Tool(s)**: Claude

How I use Claude to write LinkedIn posts that generate over 1M monthly impressions consistently and millions in monthly pipeline.

Most people treat LLMs like content generators - throw in a prompt, get output, move on. But after hundreds of LinkedIn posts and over 10M impressions in 2025, I've learned what actually works. And it's not better prompts. It's better context engineering.

My context engineering runs on three layers: past conversations, reusable knowledge, and instructions.

- **Conversations:** running inside a dedicated Claude Project means Claude can access our previous work without cross-contamination from unrelated threads - every conversation compounds the context, and Claude picks up gems from posts we've already refined together.
- **Reusable Knowledge:** I build (using Claude) reusable knowledge as "skills" - my content pillars, brand voice, example posts etc. So instead of dumping everything into every prompt, Claude pulls only what's relevant to the task at hand. The more skills Claude has, the better it gets (which is the opposite if it's in the prompt).
- **Instructions:** My instructions are optimized for Human+AI collaboration, not generic LLM output. First, I force Claude to think creatively before responding, then follow an opinionated collaborative workflow (attached below), and finally ensure that it extracts the right human feedback from me at the right time.

**Caveat:** this system generates 1M+ impressions monthly and drives millions in pipeline - but only because I have a point of view worth amplifying. Remember - without something original to say, the best architecture in the world just produces polished noise.

## AI generated assets

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Josh Grant**, Webflow
**Tool(s)**: airops, Claude

Webinars can make great source material. They're full of real human language, expertise, and context that models interpret as credible. Repurposing makes them fresh, structured, and consistently discoverable by both people and AI.

**The workflow:**
- **Step 1: Transcribed webinars.** Used AirOps to extract transcripts and high-intent Q&A moments. (Descript or Gumloop are other options.)
- **Step 2: Identified content themes.** Ran the transcript through an LLM to identify themes, entities, and recurring pain points.
- **Step 3: Pulled out quotes.** These included expert soundbites and takeaways for reuse across formats.
- **Step 4: Generated assets.** Each content theme becomes a blog recap (with quotes and timestamps), social/email snippet, and an FAQ block with schema for SEO and AEO.
- **Step 5: Added an editorial review.** The human review ensured tone and clarity. Everything goes live within 24 hours.

**Results:** 5-10 content assets per webinar | 80% reduction in post-production time | higher AI visibility around these topics

[Image: A workflow diagram titled "Webinar Content Automation" showing the process of scaling expert-driven content from webinars. The workflow starts with a video or transcript, parses speaker details, identifies 3-4 main topics, extracts insights and keywords, and finally generates expert-driven content in the brand voice. The diagram shows nodes like "Parse Transcript", "Process Transcription", "Identify Main Topic", and connects them with arrows, indicating the flow of data and processing steps.]

## AI content refreshing

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Josh Grant**, Webflow
**Tool(s)**: airops, Webflow, Profound

AI reshuffles answers constantly. Refresh velocity can be the difference between staying on top and missing out. This is nearly impossible to do manually or on a one-off project basis. Webflow built an AI-driven workflow to 5x the frequency of their content refreshes.

**The workflow:**
- **Looked for bottlenecks.** Identified which steps slowed the refresh cycle (for Webflow: keyword research, content gap analysis, and CMS ops).
- **Integrated automation.** Connected their CMS to AirOps to generate AI-driven refresh suggestions and one-click publish approvals.
- **Prioritized.** Scored content by decline, drift, and emerging AI search trends.
- **Automated the loop.** For each page flagged, the system analyzed gaps, suggested rewrites, wrapped them in schema, and pushed drafts for review.
- **Evolved.** Tracked before/after metrics (traffic, citations, conversions). Used signals from Profound to guide their next refresh cycle.

**Result:** 5x faster refresh velocity | +40% traffic uplift on refreshed pages

[Image: A screenshot of a workflow automation tool on the left, and a user interface for content improvement on the right. The workflow shows steps like "Identifies primary topic," "Generates targeted content updates," "Includes human-review checkpoints," and "Pushes updates back to Webflow Blog CMS." The UI on the right shows a "Proposed Improvement" for a text snippet about web fonts, with options to Accept or Reject the change.]

## AI competitor pages

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Matteo Tittarelli**, Genesys Growth
**Tool(s)**: Claude, clay

**Use case:** Build competitor's comparison pages with Clay + Claude + Webflow

- **Step 1:** Build lists of competitors across multiple adjacent market categories as Clay tables: eg. You vs {competitor}, You vs {category}, {competitor} vs {competitor} across multiple categories.
- **Step 2:** Run enrichment on Clay to scrape: websites, features, resources, reviews, pricing, support
- **Step 3:** Run Claude columns on Clay to create headlines for each component of the competitor table + Comparative sections like Strengths and Weaknesses + FAQs
- **Step 4:** Format comparison table copy into rich HTML to render into Webflow
- **Step 5:** Push all copy headlines to Webflow (based on a pre-designed, pre-mapped wireframe) via Make workflow that acts as 'router' (Clay/Webflow integration currently rejects rich HTML text)
- **Bonus step:** Pre-load attachments into Clay Claude columns especially ICP, TOV guidelines, and example outputs of headlines and HTML rich text

**Why it's been great for my clients:**
- Created 1,600+ pages in two months
- Triple-digits growth on organic impressions, clicks, and traffic (on already triple-digits impression headlines!), +150% CTR, stable conversions, 85% CSAT survey)
- Rank #1 consistent AIOs (AI Overviews) for pricing queries (eg. {competitor} pricing)
- Great positioning asset (your stance on the market, how you differentiate, and where everyone fits, it's *your* POV)
- Great enablement asset (reps can use it in sales calls as battle cards and/or social proof)
- Great brand asset (you build authority and an overall helpful comparison tool)

## AI generated FAQs

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Josh Grant**, Webflow
**Tool(s)**: airops, Webflow, Profound

FAQ sections answer long-tail questions and help LLMs get a more granular understanding of the product. The Q&A structure makes it easy for an LLM like ChatGPT to easily “borrow” your content in their response, which makes the content more likely to be cited. But they can be painful to maintain and optimize. Webflow automates FAQs by connecting what people are actually asking (pulled from Google and Reddit) with how AI models surface results. They ran this across six core feature pages (Design, CMS, SEO, Shared Libraries, Interactions, Hosting) and saw visibility climb across nearly every tracked query.

**The workflow:**
- **Scraped real user questions.** Pulled questions from Google's People Also Ask, Reddit, and niche subreddits. Tools like AirOps, Perplexity, or Gumloop can automate clustering around your product or category.
- **Audited their FAQs on feature pages.** Fed the current FAQ set into an LLM to identify missing topics, outdated answers, or unclear phrasing.
- **Generated new FAQs and answers.** Used GPT-5 and Claude to create clear, credible, structured answers. Prioritize comprehension over creativity.
- **Auto-added a schema markup.** Pushed the updated FAQ into the CMS with schema markup using AirOps (this syncs directly to Webflow). This made the content machine-readable for AI systems.
- **Iterated.** Used Profound to track LLM citations and visibility shifts. Refreshed lagging pages and scaled the winners.

**Results:** +24% SEO impressions | +331 new AI citations

## AI knowledge graph

**CONTENT CREATION**

**Dima Durah**, Record Scratch Productions
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

Turn a live website into a machine-readable knowledge graph (KG) and an interactive HTML explorer, then derive llms.txt and robots.txt directly from that graph. The result is a single source of truth that works simultaneously for agentic AI grounding, human exploration, and crawler discovery, without manual duplication or SEO-era hacks.

**The workflow:**
- **Step 1: Load the website in ChatGPT Atlas.** Open the page you want to convert and make sure the full page context is available.
- **Step 2: Generate a dense knowledge graph as interactive HTML.** Use the Atlas prompt below to extract all semantically meaningful entities and relationships and output a single self-contained interactive HTML file with embedded KG JSON.
- **Step 3: Export the KG JSON.** Use the “Export JSON” button in the HTML to download the raw graph (`nodes + edges`) as structured data.
- **Step 4: Generate llms.txt and robots.txt from the KG JSON.** Feed the KG JSON back into ChatGPT (or Atlas) using the conversion prompt to generate: (a) `llms.txt` for LLM/agent grounding and discovery, (b) `robots.txt` for crawler directives and discoverability hints.
- **Step 5: Deploy to site (Lovable).** Add `llms.txt` and `robots.txt` at the root (or as plain-text routes). Optionally host the interactive KG HTML as a public artifact or internal tool.

## AI persona researcher

**MARKETING**

**Francesca Krihely-Price**, dbt Labs
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

I've spent most of my career catering to technical practitioners and I have a lot less experience building GTM motions for executives. I wanted to see if a conversation with ChatGPT could help close some of the gaps for me. Did I use these outright in my final product? No. But I was able to get my work started and come to the problem a bit more informed.

**Sample prompts:**

- `Imagine you are a data executive at a larger public company. Your team is using an older data stack with technologies like [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2] and [Competitor 3]. How are you thinking about modernizing your data stack? What are you using to learn about your migration process?`
- `I think these suggestions are more in line with how an IC Data Engineer would keep up with news. Can you push a bit to see what other learning paths exist for these executives?`
- `I would love to construct these insights into an adoption map that I can use at my Company. Can you build me an adoption map that goes from awareness to consideration to purchase and help me identify events, content and campaigns that can help move these executives between stages.`

## AI paid spend analyst

**MARKETING**

**Andrea Kayal**, Help Scout
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

We wanted to check to see if there's any impact to our organic/direct sign-ups when we have our paid search spend on. While this analysis can be done pretty easily in other tools, this was done in less than a minute with ChatGPT.

**Here's the prompt:**
`Using the following data set which includes paid media spend, can you determine if there is a correlation between paid media spend and organic/direct traffic? If so, what's the strength of the correlation?`

**Here's the answer we got back:**
The correlation coefficient between spend and organic/direct trials is 0.5325. Positive correlation: The correlation is positive, which means that as spending increases, there tends to be an increase in organic/direct trials as well. A correlation of 0.5325 indicates a moderate positive relationship between the two variables. It's not a perfect correlation (which would be 1.0), but it's substantial enough to suggest a meaningful relationship.

## AI competitor ad analyst

**MARKETING**

**Torsten Walbaum**, Operator's Handbook
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

You can see all ads that competitors ran, including private message ads, in an ad library. Instead of sifting through all this information manually for days, you can just let AI do the heavy lifting.

Perplexity does an acceptable job, but the real solution is to turn on Agent Mode in ChatGPT. It's advertised as the bridge between research and action, and that's exactly what it is. You can just tell it to open up the ad library, look at 50 - 100 ads, and write up a detailed report. When prompted correctly, it's essentially Deep Research with additional skills: It can log into accounts, click on toggles and filters, take screenshots etc.

**This is what an effective prompt would look like:**

`<goal>` I'm trying to understand how [Company] uses LinkedIn ads to grow. Please leverage the LinkedIn Ads library (https://www.linkedin.com/ad-library/) to put together a comprehensive report on their positioning, messaging and tactics. `</goal>`

`<context>` The detail page for every ad will have a lot of relevant information to consider. For example, it shows what type of ad it is, from when to when it was active, how many impressions it got across regions etc. `</context>`

`<content>` Please cover at a minimum the following: - What ad formats (e.g. message ads vs. single image) and types (e.g. customer case studies, CEO thought leadership etc.) they're running - Which buyer personas they seem to be targeting - How they position themselves and core messages to their audiences - What their calls-to-action look like - What incentives they offer (e.g. money or gifts to take demos) Please make sure to include concrete examples for any claim you make (i.e. link to specific ads inline). Please link to at least 20 concrete ad examples (the URL will look like "https://www.linkedin.com/ad-library/detail/[ad_id]") `</content>`

`<instructions>` Please review 50+ ads and create a detailed report of 3,000 words or more summarizing your findings `</instructions>`

## AI GTM operator

**MARKETING**

**Ashley Cheng**, Usersnap
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

**What is it?** Co-pilot product content with ready internal docs

**What is the set up?** Build a custom GPT that's effectively your smartest new GTM hire — except it doesn't need onboarding. It's trained on your internal documentation and strongest existing assets, enabling it to produce accurate, on-brand product marketing across all GTM communication needs.

Instead of starting from a blank page or running repeated enablement sessions across teams, this GTM Machine is just ready. It can even absorb your customers' language, so the output feels natural and familiar. Best part: it removes collaboration bottlenecks entirely, your GTM work moves forward without meetings, handoffs, or back-and-forth!

**What you feed the AI?** All these materials are uploaded directly into the custom GPT and treated as authoritative, not just “inspiration”.
- **Brand information:** Vision and mission, Positioning statement, Persona profiles, List of competitors, Tone of voice and writing guidelines
- **Product knowledge:** PRDs, Changelog and release notes, Help center documentation, Onboarding and lifecycle emails
- **Marketing & sales assets:** Website, Blog posts, Pitch decks, Battle cards, Social media top performing posts
- **User content:** Case studies; G2 reviews, or some quotes examples; Usersnap, or some user feedback examples

**How it's used day to day?** When a new feature is ready to go to market, upload the PRD and confirm your brand and core GTM docs are up to date. From there, prompt the GPT with a simple, structured request, for example:

`Write a [asset type] for [persona] to introduce [new feature]. Make it on-brand and stand out from [competitors].`

Review the first draft and quickly refine it to ensure it clearly covers: (1) What's different about the product, (2) The specific pain points of the target persona, (3) How it compares to alternatives, (4) Alignment with branding.

Once the asset is ready, ship it and move on to the next format, no re-explaining context.

## AI CMO coach

**MARKETING**

**Natalie Taylor**, Capsule
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

I built the CMO Coach because there is a lot I don't know about running marketing at a Series A company. Unbeknownst to her, Emily Kramer has become an important mentor through her MKT1 newsletter, and I decided to basically make my own Emily coach. I fed it her most important "Kramework"s, templates, and guidance, as well as context on our company, team, customers, product, key perceptions, GTM strategy, and revenue goals. I've used the coach to help with quarterly and annual planning, as well as being a sounding board for CEO conversations.

Here's a snippet of the configuration: CMO Coach is a focused executive coach and mentor for B2B startup CMOs—especially Series A software companies—combining pragmatic operator experience with Emily Kramer's MKT1 frameworks. It helps users set strategy, build plans, and execute with measurable impact. It coaches in a direct, structured, and motivating tone that prioritizes tradeoffs, sequencing, and avoiding Random Acts of Marketing.

The Custom GPT now has detailed context on the company: [Redacted]

**Behavioral rules and capabilities:**
- Emphasize MKT1 principles: first-principles strategy, ruthless prioritization, impact-driven planning, account-driven GTM, Fuel & Engine alignment, Marketing Advantages, and K.P.O. goals. Always remind users to avoid Random Acts of Marketing (RAM).
- Bias toward concrete frameworks, prioritization, and templates-in-spirit outputs (Marketing Decision Dashboard™, GACCS briefs, K.P.O. goal setting, funnel skeletons, account tiering, and rules of engagement).
- When context is complete—as in Capsule's case—generate tangible plans rather than ask clarifying questions.
- Recommend next hires, experiments, and sequencing tailored to Capsule's enterprise up-market motion and events-led engine.

**Interaction style:**
- Tone: Executive coach + pragmatic operator — direct, structured, motivating. Reflect Emily Kramer's MKT1 approach: crisp, framework-heavy, execution-oriented.
- Personalization: Tailored specifically for Capsule's context: Series A, enterprise ACV, creative-leader ICP, events-led motion, outbound acceleration.
- Clarification policy: Make reasonable assumptions and state them clearly.

## AI messaging coach

**MARKETING**

**Raj Sarkar**, Cloudbees
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

I can highlight two use cases – one personal and one professional – for an AI messaging coach.

The personal use case is a custom GPT I have built and trained over the months called "RajGPT". It is trained in my voice, my operating principles, my leadership philosophy, my resume, my playbooks, etc. It knows a lot about me so I use it regularly to help me craft posts: `"I want to write a LinkedIn Post about how every single company in the world is building an AI wrapper and how I predict that many of them will go out of business in the coming years."`

The professional use case is something we have built for the sales team called "BeeCoach". Think about it as an extension of sales enablement. The GPT has been trained on all CloudBees messaging and positioning, product features, pitches, etc. Now a sales person can go and try the following prompt:

- `"I am writing a cold email to the CIO of Walmart. Walmart is currently not a customer of CloudBees but uses GitHub and GitLab. Help me write a pitch for CloudBees Unify."`
- `“I am a rep that supports (insert region) - give me 5 top companies in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 employees that fits Cloudbees Unify ICP."`

Before they used to come to us for every small request. Now they have a sales enablement PMM on their fingertips and we have heard rave reviews from the sales team.

## AI digital twin

**MARKETING**

**Kieran Flanagan**, HubSpot
**Tool(s)**: Claude

How I use Claude to simulate customer reactions to our marketing before it even launches

Most marketers use customer research sparingly because it takes so long. But what if you could have customer research on top, and ask for opinions of your work before it ever launches? After reading research from PyMC Labs and Colgate-Palmolive, I realised AI can act as your customer's digital twin and give accurate feedback to help you iterate faster.

My digital twin runs on three layers: real customer data, behavioral insights, and anchor statements.
- **Customer data:** I feed Claude real signals - sales call transcripts, G2 reviews, CRM objection notes. This grounds the twin in actual buyer language, not AI hallucinations about what customers "might" think.
- **Behavioral insights:** I ask Claude to surface patterns - motivations, emotional drivers, objections, buying triggers. This is where the accuracy comes from. You're not asking "would they buy?" - you're mapping why they buy or why they walk away.
- **Anchor statements:** Instead of asking Claude to rate something 1-5 (which makes AI default to vague "3s"), I create five reference statements in customer language; from "this sounds too complex, not worth switching" to "this is exactly what we've been looking for." When Claude evaluates my campaign, it writes a natural response, then tells me which anchor it's closest to. You get the score and the reasoning.

Then I load everything into a Claude Project as a persistent "digital twin" I can test any campaign against. Caveat: this system gives you the accuracy on purchase intent, but only if you feed it real customer data. Synthetic data in, synthetic insights out. The twin is only as good as the voice-of-customer you train it on.

## AI competitive intelligence

**MARKETING**

**Justin Norris**, 360Learning
**Tool(s)**: Claude, Gemini, Retool, Dust

**The use case:** BattleBot is a sales co-pilot for our revenue teams. It analyzes Gong and opportunity data, then provides competitive strategy, research, case studies, landmines, and whatever else they need to win.

**Why we built it:** Traditional battlecards are static and aren't customized to a specific deal. Competitive intelligence is also bottlenecked by Product Marketing bandwidth to conduct research and analysis. BattleBot solves both: we scale human insight by automating pipelines of competitive intel and win-loss analysis, then make that insight accessible and dynamic through a conversational interface.

**The workflow:**
- On the back-end, we run daily research and analysis pipelines across many dimensions (news, calls, opportunities, etc.). AI conducts a first layer of analysis with a human in the loop to approve. This database of insights and analysis is exposed to BattleBot, who is only a prompt away for sellers.
- We use Retool + Gemini to drive our AI workflows. That gives us granular win/loss analyses and a first level summary.
- We expose that knowledge to an assistant built in Dust (using Claude 4.5 Sonnet under the hood). It has access to a range of data and tools and can apply the insights contextually to help sellers in the flow of work.

## AI SAM scoring algorithm

**MARKETING**

**Liam Gandelsman**, Galileo
**Tool(s)**: clay, Claude, zoominfo

After noticing a subset of deals closing faster than our average, we built a binary scoring model combining hard data (revenue, age, industry) with AI research to pinpoint high-potential prospects. Companies passing both checks receive increased marketing spend and sales focus. The goal of this algorithm is to create a perpetually running scoring model that answers in a simple true or false whether a company is within your serviceable addressable market (SAM).

Here's how you can recreate our model:
1.  **Create the following fields in your CRM:**
    -   A true/false field for your final output
    -   An additional details field to output the LLM's reasoning for selecting true/false
    -   Optional: A last modified date so reps can quickly see when the score was updated
2.  **Come up with your list of non-negotiables:** any firmographic or technographic data points that providers like ZoomInfo or really anything you can plug into or get from Clay will offer in a structured database (ex: Revenue >= $20m)
3.  **Set your nice-to-haves.** These can be things like number of people with a specific title or for AirOps, the number of recent SEO posts. This may be a little trickier to import into your Clay table as structured data, but it's worth the effort
4.  **Workshop the vibes-based component of your definition with your reasoning model of choice.** I personally like to use Claude Sonnet and make a lot of manual edits to make sure the definition is rock solid. Create a Claygent column in your Clay table that with the research prompt you created. What I like to do is bring a fully baked prompt from another LLM and paste it into the meta-prompter inside the Claygent setup. What I found this does is it reformats my prompt in a way that Clay better understands. Here's a prompt you can use to get started crafting your Claygent instructions:
    -   `I'm creating a Claygent research prompt to better understand my serviceable addressable market. Help me produce all the potential data points and research sources we can instruct Claygent to use in order to answer the following question: [your SAM question/definition].`
    -   `Don't write the prompt yet, help me brainstorm, then we'll craft the prompt instructions.`
5.  **Pick a subset of 10-30 accounts that you know meet your criteria and another 10-30 that don't.** Run the prompt many times with different LLMs to test the cost and accuracy
6.  **When you feel confident, backfill all the data for existing accounts at your CRM** and set up a report or segment that automatically triggers new accounts to be scored by the Clay table when they're created in the CRM
    -   Make sure that in your production Clay table you have conditional run settings set so only the rows that meet your non-negotiable and nice-to-have criteria get scored.

## AI pain point database (1 of 2)

**MARKETING**

**Ryan McCready**, Quo
**Tool(s)**: zapier, ChatGPT, Notion

**Intro Calls → Pain Point Database**

- Extracts sentiment, pain points, objections, and feature requests from sales calls. Creates tagged Notion docs with quotes we can actually use to improve our messaging/content.
- Someone on your team drops a transcript into the Zapier Interfaces form to kick off the Zap. You can also hook it directly up to Gong, Fellow, etc.
- Zapier pulls and cleans the TXT file with JavaScript so it's ready for the OpenAI API. The first AI step uses GPT-4.1 Mini to grab all the important sales stuff: pain points, quotes, questions, timeline, competitors, what tools they're using now.
- The second AI step extracts context from the call: buying triggers, use cases, security requirements, who's involved, quick summary.
- Then a code step takes both responses, cleans everything up into arrays, and formats it for Notion. The last step dumps all the info into your "Intro Call Database" as a new record with every field filled out.
- From transcript to report in literal seconds, with no manual work. And since it's built in Notion, you can easily share the database with your team or access it from ChatGPT or Claude.

## AI website visitor campaign

**PROSPECTING**

**Brendan Short**, The Signal
**Tool(s)**: Apollo, Common Room, zoominfo, RE-B, Warmly, unify

**AI website visitor campaign**
- Any time a company or person visits your website, you can de-anonymize them and send them a message. (Be sure to track high intent pages like your pricing page or developer documentation.)
- Tools that do this: Apollo (company-level only), CommonRoom, RB2B, Unify, Warmly, and ZoomInfo. Most of these have a free trial, so test them!
- Pro-tip: Don't explicitly say "I just saw you were on our pricing page, want a demo?!"

[Image: A flowchart diagram illustrating an automated workflow for handling website visitors. The flow starts with "Signal Detected: Website Visitor". It then goes to "CRM lookup" to check if the account exists. If not, it goes to "Enrich" to see if it fits the ICP. If it's an ICP fit, the action is to "Alert sales rep or send email automatically". If the account does exist in the CRM, it checks if it's a customer. If not, it alerts the sales rep. If it is a customer, the action is to "Alert Account Manager".]

## AI cold copy generator

**PROSPECTING**

**Natalie Taylor**, Capsule
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

I built and launched our first outbound campaign 2+ years ago, inviting people to our VIP dinners. It performed incredibly well, and part of it was the tone, structure and length. As we brought on more SDRs, I wanted to share best practices with them. I'm also a big fan of Jen Allen-Knuth, so I uploaded her frameworks for cold copy.

Here's a snippet of the configuration:

This GPT is a persuasive sales professional who specializes in crafting high-performing cold emails that get opened and replied to. It follows the DemandJen framework outlined in the Women in Sales May 2025 workshop and emphasizes clear, direct, and concise communication. It avoids fluff, generic sales language, and spammy phrasing, instead favoring straightforward, human-sounding messaging.

Subject lines are modeled after real human emails: short (1–3 words), familiar, and curiosity-piquing. Messaging tone is direct and empathetic, using social proof and credible cues without over-selling. Emails are structured around buyer-centric problems tied to CEO-level business objectives, using hypotheses generated from fast account research. The message format typically includes an observation, a hypothesized problem (with unsure tonality), social proof, and a soft call to learn. Emails should ideally be about 3 lines of body copy. Occasionally add some small, but not egregious mistakes in the copy/grammar to make it look more human.

This GPT avoids robotic or formulaic patterns and instead writes like a thoughtful, strategic seller who has done their homework. It helps users refine hooks, calls to action, and body copy while ensuring messaging is relevant, mobile-friendly, and under ~50 words when possible.

It asks clarifying questions to tailor outputs to the user's goals, ICP, and offering: [Redacted].

Goal: Secure a reply and ultimately book a sales intro call.

Channels: Email and LinkedIn; follow-up messages tend to drive engagement.

Tone: Direct, concise, relevant. No fluff. Empathetic but to the point. Unsure tonality when referencing their business context. Human-sounding subject lines (1-3 words).

## AI custom lead enrichment

**PROSPECTING**

**Hamish Grant**, SafetyCulture
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT, zoominfo, HubSpot

SafetyCulture's customers literally come from everywhere, but tend to be in industries that aren't traditional technology buyers like manufacturing, retail, transportation, construction, and even mining. Depending on a single enrichment platform left gaps: data was incomplete, patchy, and quickly outdated.

**The experiment:** Build an AI-powered lead enrichment that's platform-agnostic, calling five providers in parallel. (This is similar to tools like Clay, but built in-house.)

**The workflow:**
1. The agent progressively calls a string of third-party providers until sufficient data is found, also known as waterfall enrichment.
2. The agent will choose the highest value for each property.
3. Another agent fact checks this against publicly available information, such as the company's website and LinkedIn.
4. For US based leads, another agent searches OSHA's API for any recent violations, this gives the GTM team context around the kind of workplace risks a company faces. Any supporting information is appended to the Lead and sent as a summary in Slack.
5. AI agents compile a final output based on the best possible information.

**Results:** Eliminated hundreds of hours of manual research, increased enrichment to near-100% coverage, gave GTM teams (and the AI Auto BDR) the intelligence to engage immediately with higher-fit customers.

[Image: A composite visual with a data table and a Slack message screenshot. The table shows how data for a lead is consolidated from multiple sources (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, LLM) into a final, more accurate Output. For example, 'Employees' shows 900 from ZoomInfo, 750 from Clearbit, and the final Output is 900. 'Industry' shows Manufacturing from both, but the LLM provides 'Retail', which is chosen for the final Output. The Slack message screenshot shows a detailed lead alert, including matching recent OSHA records for the company, providing deep context for the sales team.]

## AI personalized ABM campaign

**PROSPECTING**

**Dave Rigotti**, Inflection
**Tool(s)**: Apollo, ChatGPT, n8n

We finally cracked outbound at scale for Inflection because of AI-based personalization. We're now booking more meetings per month WITHOUT BDRs than when we had 2 BDRs. Here's how we do it:

- "Week in review" emails are a popular Inflection use case.
- We use AI to scan our prospects websites: download their logo, grab their brand colors, analyze their website for how someone might use their product. This is built via n8n (see the workflow diagram below) with OpenAI and company information from Apollo.
- Then AI generates a sample "week in review" email for their company.

It took 8 hours to setup the AI, 1 hour to generate 1,000s of account-specific “week in review” emails, and it cost less than $10 in AI credits.

[Image: A detailed workflow diagram from the n8n automation tool. The flow shows multiple steps like "Load Companies", "Get Logo", "Upload Logo", "Generate Email Template", "Take Screenshot", and "Store URL". This workflow automates the creation of personalized "Week in Review" emails. The slide also shows example outputs: a grid of several generated "Week in Review" email previews for different companies like Thinkific, Testsigma, and Terminal, demonstrating the personalized output at scale.]

## AI outbound micro-campaigns (1)

**PROSPECTING**

**Mike Ryan**, Crescendo
**Tool(s)**: HubSpot, instantly, Nooks, clay, heyreach

We've built out some pretty wild AI-powered outbound and micro-ABM workflows using Clay, RB2B, Instantly and ChatGPT. They're driving strong results, faster conversions, big pipeline lift and super-personalized outreach that adapts in real time to buying signals.

Crescendo's marketing and sales teams use a human-in-the-loop AI system that automates prospecting, research, and sequencing across three distinct funnels: ABM, outbound, and inbound-to-outbound. The system combines HubSpot, Clay, Instantly, Heyreach, Nooks, and OutboundSync, with Gong for discovery-call intelligence and Slack for live routing. The AI engine autonomously identifies, enriches, and engages prospects, then hands off to humans at key conversion points.

**Impact metrics**
- Pipeline creation by the AI engine: Millions of $ in pipeline with more than 200% quarter over quarter growth.
- AI engine creates ~25% of overall pipeline.
- 50%+ open rates on AI-generated emails.

[Image: A complex workflow diagram illustrating three parallel funnels for customer engagement. The top funnel is for marketing signals (ABM, Social). The middle is for outbound sales. The bottom is for inbound leads. All funnels feed into a central processing system using tools like HubSpot for CRM, Clay for enrichment, and Instantly/HeyReach/Nooks for sequencing. The outputs are routed via OutboundSync and can trigger alerts in Slack or analysis in Gong, showing a highly integrated and automated GTM motion.]

**Mike Ryan**, Crescendo
**Tool(s)**: HubSpot, instantly, Nooks, clay, heyreach

**Prospect Identification**
Marketing and sales upload or tag accounts based on ICP, ABM signals, or social metadata. Clay enriches each record with phone, email, LinkedIn, tech stack, and outsourcing data. The system refreshes accounts weekly, giving BDRs and marketing a new set of prioritized targets based on the most recent buying signals.

**Automated Research and Sequencing**
The system auto-generates email, LinkedIn, and call sequences. Sequences are sent via Instantly, HeyReach, and Nooks. Replies automatically stop the sequence.

**Prospect Prioritization and BDR Enablement**
HubSpot prioritizes and assigns tasks to BDRs based on enrichment data, engagement signals, and ICP fit from the previous steps. AI call scripts are generated directly on each contact record. Each BDR has a personalized Clay table, filtered by ICP fit and campaign relevance.

**Engagement and Handoff**
BDRs engage prospects using hyper-personalized, AI-generated messaging and Gong-recorded discovery calls. No-shows automatically re-enter Clay for resequencing. Qualified opportunities are passed to sales automatically.

**Closed-Loop Feedback**
Replies sync back to HubSpot and Slack via OutboundSync. Marketing logs win/loss data and attaches Gong recordings to discovery calls. Non-responses trigger resequencing through Clay.

## AI product-led sales play

**PROSPECTING**

**Brendan Short**, The Signal
**Tool(s)**: Apollo, clay, Common Room, zoominfo

**Turning signups into an outbound account-based sales motion (product-led sales)**
- When a (PLG) user becomes a product-qualified lead (PQL), automatically reach out to that user and have a system fetch other users at the company who are not yet in your product (end users and decision makers) and add them into sequences to build “outbound” groundswell across the org.
- **Pro-tip:** For low ACV products, the call-to-action in the outreach should be to drive free sign-ups. For high ACV products, the call-to-action is to gather information from end-users that you package into a deck and send to the decision maker. The deck should show their feedback/pain, how your product solves it, and data on how much product usage is happening across their team.

[Image: A flowchart diagram illustrating an automated workflow for website visitors, which can be adapted for product-led sales. It starts with "Signal Detected: Website Visitor". It then follows a logic path: "CRM lookup" to check for an existing account, then "Enrich" to check for ICP fit, and finally triggers an "Action" such as alerting a sales rep or an account manager based on the data.]

## AI meeting prep

**SALES**

**Joey Maddox**, Verisoul
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

AI becomes exponentially more useful as you increase the surface area of data it can access. Before any meeting, we upload all prior meeting transcripts, LinkedIn conversations, email threads, HubSpot info, and website information into a custom GPT. The GPT shares a summary of all prior meeting history, LinkedIn overviews, and potential issues the prospect is facing. In addition, the transcripts are all query-able, so we can ask any questions on prior meetings in real-time.

Thus, in ~2 mins, we have all the context we need for every meeting. The whole process right now is orchestrated by an SDR (takes him 5 mins), though we're looking to automate the upload component as well.

It's a custom GPT inside of ChatGPT. We simply paste in the following items in order:
- Calendar event details
- Email Convo
- Previous meeting summaries
- Linkedin Convo (if there's any)
- Slack Convo (if there's any)
- Company details
- Linkedin Profile of the other party

The prompt for the custom GPT essentially asks for these 4 outputs: (1) Attendees & Personal Details, (2) Purpose of Today's Meeting, (3) Summary of Past Meetings, (4) Prospect Context & Opportunity.

## AI personalized events

**SALES**

**Andrea Kayal**, Help Scout
**Tool(s)**: ChatGPT

Help Scout hosts intimate dinner events for CEOs and customer support leaders. We fill the events by targeting a list of individuals and we will get between 30-50 registrations for each dinner.

So that the dinner can feel more personalized, we research each participant and seat those with similar backgrounds next to each other and share those interests with them to help generate conversations.

**Here's the prompt:**
`Here is a list of participants that will be attending our intimate dinner gatherings. You will find websites to their companies and their email addresses. Would you be able to search their LinkedIn and other relevant sources like social media to create profiles of their likes and interests?`

`Given their likes and interests, I would like to create a seating chart that puts people together so they have interesting talking points.`

## AI interactive ROI calculator

**SALES**

**Alex Shartsis**, Skyp
**Tool(s)**: b

**Tools:** I used Bolt.new, which can turn prompts and spreadsheets into functional React apps. From start to finish, it took maybe two hours.

**Here's what I gave it:** (1) the original spreadsheet (a screenshot), (2) the README/instructions for how it worked, on a tab in that spreadsheet (a second screenshot), (3) a pretty lengthy initial prompt (typos included, below).

**Here's the recipe, feel free to try it yourself:**
`Build an ROI calculator. It should match the look and feel of picomes.com. Here are the instructions for it and a screenshot of the Excel version. Ask questions one or two at a time, like a typeform, rather than all at once. It should start with a page introducing itself and telling of its value. Then the user enters their email (and confirms it). For now we can set up a supabase to track this and other responses. Then we would list the general stuff they would need. Allow them to progressively answer questions, and save progress as they go. The questions should start with do you plan on selling your business in the next 10 years? (they can skip this question). If yes, they should be asked when they expect to sell. Then at the end it should present how much extra profit they would make before they sell (eg if it's $500,000/year and they're selling in 4 years, $2mm) and then use a multiple of 11x Ebitda (that is a variable they can change) to show how much more their company would be worth if they use our software.`

**Result:** When I showed the ROI calculator project to the founder of Pico MES, he was blown away. He said his HubSpot agency would have charged him $10k for something like this and taken a month to build it, if they even came back with something usable. Here was an amazing looking tool his sales team could use right now, ready in a few hours.

## AI re-engagement

**SALES**

**Elaine Zelby**, Tofu
**Tool(s)**: HubSpot, Amplemarket

**The setup:** Sybill (AI call recorder), HubSpot (CRM + Marketing automation), Tofu (personalized content creation), HubSpot + Amplemarket (email + LI execution), LinkedIn (ads)

Deals that are closed lost are much easier to re-engage than getting a brand new logo aware, educated, interested, and signed so we've automated our re-engagement. We use Sybill as our AI call recorder which is connected to HubSpot. We created about 12 custom fields following our sales methodology (SPICED) plus other things like tech stack, etc. and Sybill listens and fills in and updates information based on the calls.

When a deal is moved to the closed lost stage in HubSpot, it's automatically added to a dynamic list of “Closed Lost Deals” and added to a HubSpot workflow to re-engage. There is a 90-day wait step and then they start receiving content. After the 90 day wait period, the deal is automatically sent to a Tofu campaign that ingests the fields that Sybill created and other fields like closed lost reason, notes, etc. For each deal Tofu runs an additional research agent looking for any new chances to marketing leadership, new campaigns, events, or content they're recently produced, and any updates to their GTM motion.

**Exact prompt:** `Have they had any new marketing leadership changes in the past 3 months? What personas and industries do they sell to? What types of marketing content and campaigns are they currently running? Have they made any major announcements, hosted or had a major presence at any events in the past 3 months? Have they made any recent changes to their GTM motion?`

It gets combined with the CRM fields and Tofu creates personalized content for each contact: (1) 4 marketing emails, (2) 4 sales emails, (3) 2 LinkedIn DMs, and (4) a 1:1 landing page.

The landings are exported back to our CMS (Webflow) and dynamic links are embedded in the emails and DMs. The marketing emails containing personalization tokens for the subject lines and bodies get exported to HubSpot and added to the workflow. The sales emails and LinkedIn DM personalization tokens are added to an Amplemarket sequence (and Amplemarket is integrated into HubSpot). The account also gets added to a LinkedIn Campaign Manager audience where we start showing their marketing team ads (these are 1:many).

## AI sales analyst (1 of 2)

**SALES**

**Jonathan Kvarfordt**, Momentum
**Tool(s)**: NotebookLM, momentum

Most marketers treat call transcripts like data graveyards: recorded, stored, never analyzed. After analyzing hundreds of customer conversations at Momentum.io, I've learned what actually works is better instruction architecture. We do this type of analysis naturally at Momentum, but if I did not have Momentum, here is what I would do to leverage NotebookLM to gain leverage.

My NotebookLM runs on three layers or 3 main documents: Master Doc, Brand Doc, and Analysis Doc
- **Master Control:** A single document NotebookLM reads FIRST that cascades instructions to specialized sub-documents. This creates a reusable framework that transforms raw transcripts into strategic intelligence without re-prompting every time.
- **Brand Standards:** I encode brand voice, forbidden phrases, hex codes, and pronunciation rules (because nothing kills credibility like AI mispronouncing "Momentum.io"). This ensures every output - whether podcast, deck, or report - sounds and looks like it came from our team.
- **Analysis Protocol:** Rather than asking "what are the insights?", I give NotebookLM a forensic framework: analyze language patterns (what words CUSTOMERS use vs what WE use), objection architecture (price vs feature vs timing), buying triggers, moments of confusion, and competitive intelligence. Every insight requires transcript citations and exact quotes - no marketing-speak paraphrasing allowed.

**The workflow:** Upload the instruction stack FIRST, then add 20-30 transcripts stratified by outcome (won/lost/pipeline or active pipeline conversations OR active customer conversations). Generate audio overviews for the team, slide decks for executives, or markdown reports for strategy sessions. All in 2-3 hours vs 15+ hours of manual analysis.

**The compound intelligence move:** Don't delete notebooks. Next quarter, add new transcripts to the SAME notebook. Now you're tracking pattern shifts over time - which objections decreased, which new concerns emerged, how customer language evolved. Your analysis compounds instead of resetting.
**Caveat:** This system only works if you're actually LISTENING to what customers say, not cherry-picking quotes that confirm your positioning. Remember - without genuine curiosity about customer voice, the best architecture in the world just produces confirmation bias at scale.

## AI sales analyst (2 of 2)

**SALES**

**The Master Document (Copy This)**
**INSTRUCTION CASCADE:**
1.  Apply Brand Voice Guidelines from "Source A - Brand Standards"
2.  Follow Output Formatting from "Source B - Format Rules"
3.  Execute Analysis Framework from "Source C - Analysis Protocol"

**PRONUNCIATION GUIDE (for Audio Overviews):**
- [Your company name] = "[Exactly how to say it]"
- [Your product] = "[Phonetic spelling]"
- [Industry acronyms] = "[Spell out or full phrase]"

**ANALYSIS CONTEXT:**
You are analyzing real customer/sales conversations to extract authentic voice insights for marketing strategy.

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
- Use customer language, not marketing language
- Cite specific transcripts + timestamps for every claim
- Quantify patterns (mentioned in X of Y transcripts)
- Separate what was said from what it means strategically
- Flag contradictions and outliers
- No hallucinations - if uncertain, say so

**OUTPUT RULES:**
- Audio: 8-10 min, conversational, 2-3 examples per insight
- Decks: Bold insight headlines, one pull quote per slide, brand colors
- Reports: Markdown format, executive summary + detailed sections

[Image: An infographic titled "From Transcripts to Strategy: A NotebookLM Workflow for Customer Insights". It details a four-phase process. **Phase 1: Build Your Instruction Architecture** shows creating a Master Control Document, a Brand Standards Document, and an Analysis Protocol Document. **Phase 2: Execute the 3-Step Analysis Workflow** involves uploading the instruction stack, adding customer transcripts, and generating strategic outputs like audio overviews and slide decks, reducing analysis time from 15+ hours to 2-3 hours. **Phase 3: The Pro Move: Create Compounding Intelligence** advises to add new transcripts to the existing notebook to track how customer voice evolves over time, identifying fading objections and emerging concerns. **Phase 4: The Golden Rule for Authentic Insights** warns that the system only works if you're truly listening to customers, not just confirming biases.]

## AI custom app layer

**SALES**

**Hamish Grant**, SafetyCulture
**Tool(s)**: Retool, GONG

Each GTM system has its own AI bots. None of them were uniquely designed for SafetyCulture's product. And collectively they're just another interface for sales and marketing to context switch across in order to piece together information.

**The experiment:** Replace the necessary (but clunky) systems with an AI-first interface that's one pane of glass for all customer information and the next-best-action to be taken.

**The workflow:**
1. Used Retool to build an application layer over the top of incumbent systems with two views (lead console and company viewer).
2. Pipes in all lead and customer data along with: AI enrichment and engagement data (Redshift), call transcripts (Gong), feature usage and churn predictors (Amplitude), lead routing logic.
3. Brings in Gong call transcripts and auto-generates a SPICED framework, which it writes back to Salesforce to trigger the BDR to AE hand-off.
4. AEs can use the built-in AI agent to fire account research including, for example, scraping government data to see if there might be a health and safety violation as a buying signal.
5. AEs can "ask anything” about the account (ex: What's their usage? How many paid teams do they have? What outreach approach should we take?)
6. Added conversion rate and pipeline leaderboards for friendly competition.

**The results:** >25% increase in lead-to-opportunity conversion rate and a consistent increase in the volume of pipeline created. BDRs save 30 minutes per opportunity with automated hand-offs.

**The learnings:** Over 80% of the marketing and sales team are active users of the custom app layer. Productivity gains are translating into faster response times and better quality engagement. AI agents don't need to be in autopilot mode to generate value; copilot use cases can be equally (or more) useful.

## AI call recording analyst

**SALES**

**Elena Luneva**, Elentic
**Tool(s)**: Claude, GONG, _zapier

We built an internal evaluation of Gong data using ChatGPT to define patterns for the R&D team (rather than getting the last loudest customer report), and generate sales enablement training of product features in the words our customers use.

**Here's the workflow** (we used ChatGPT, but I updated the instructions for Claude, which I found more elegant and better at extracting patterns):

1. Set up Claude project (called "Customer Intelligence Sales"). This included uploading initial knowledge base documents (ex: current ICP definitions, competitive landscape overview) and setting up the following project instructions:
`You are a customer intelligence analyst. Your role is to: (a) Analyze sales conversation transcripts from Gong, (b) Extract ICP insights, customer needs, and product feedback, (c) Maintain consistency with previous analyses, (d) Flag new trends and patterns, (e) Use customer language when possible. Context: You have access to our current ICP, product features, and competitive landscape. Always reference this context when analyzing new conversations.`

2. Configure Gong API integration. We used Zapier for this.

3. Define Claude templates. We set up standardized templates for ICP analysis, customer needs discovery, product intelligence, sales enablement intelligence, and marketing intelligence. Below is an example for ICP analysis.
   - Analyze this new Gong transcript for ICP insights: TRANSCRIPT: [Transcript content], METADATA: Company size, industry, role, deal value
   - Please provide: A. Buyer persona classification (compare to existing ICPs in project knowledge), B. New characteristics not in current ICP definitions, C. Decision-making process and stakeholders, D. Buying criteria and evaluation process, E. Budget and timeline indicators, F. Direct quoted that support findings with the role and company. Format as structured data for easy aggregation.

4. Automate analysis workflow. We set up a multi-step automation via Zapier.

5. Knowledge building. Claude remembers previous analyses and can identify trends across conversations. We ask it to send a weekly synthesis as well as a monthly deep dive.

6. Automated deliverables. This included a real-time insight dashboard, automated reports, and real-time notifications by team.

## AI is for everyone in GTM

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**

- **Staying on top of the latest trends in AI can feel overwhelming even during a slow news week.** There seems to be a never-ending onslaught of new releases, jargon, and acronyms like MCP, token, agent, AGI, fine-tuning, and evals. It leaves many of us feeling left-behind or out of touch.
- **But you don't need to be an AI expert or software engineer to start seeing value for your role.** Whether you're trying to improve your content creation, brainstorm with your product marketing copilot, automate your outbound prospecting, or be better prepared for sales meetings – it doesn't need to be all that complicated to get 90% of the value.
- **The workflows mentioned here can (mostly) be replicated with off-the-shelf tools at zero or minimal upfront cost.** A number of them could be replicated in 10 minutes or less. Go ahead, copy them – and let us know how it goes.
