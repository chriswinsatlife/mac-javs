# How to Review Converted Components

## Quick Start

1. **Open the showcase page**
    - URL: http://localhost:4321/showcase
    - Just created: it should be opening now in your browser

2. **Open browser console**
    - Mac: ⌘⌥I (Cmd+Option+I)
    - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+I or F12
    - Click "Console" tab

3. **Scroll through the page** and check each section

## What to Check

### Visual Review

- ☐ All icons render (look like the SVG shapes they should be)
- ☐ Buttons have correct colors (black, blue, white variants)
- ☐ Typography elements look right (headings, text, links)
- ☐ Sections have proper spacing and layout
- ☐ Everything looks good on mobile (resize browser window)

### Console Errors (Important!)

- ☐ Look for red errors in the console
- ☐ Copy any error messages you see
- ☐ Screenshot the console if there are errors

## Report Issues

### Option 1: Just Tell Me

Type in chat what you see, e.g.:

- "The Star icon shows a broken image"
- "Console says 'ReferenceError: Button is not defined'"
- "The Footer section is cut off on mobile"

### Option 2: Use the Checklist

Open `docs/component-review-checklist.md` and add entries for issues you find.

## I Will Fix Anything You Find

Just tell me what's wrong and I'll fix it immediately.
