| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cardinal sins of delegation**: Pride, guilt, selfishness (not named this way in manifesto but covered in barriers) | Names them explicitly: "Pride... guilt... selfishness... lack of commitment" (16:19-18:44)                                                |

| **AI as management partner** (lines 520-545, 602-616)                                                                | "AI will not solely be a worker... but also a manager and advisor" becomes his discussion of AI as copilot, auto-delegator (22:33, 41:32) |

### Statistics/Research He Cites Without Attribution

The manifesto includes specific academic citations (Bandiera et al., Whillans/Pow/Norton, etc.) that provide the empirical backing for claims he makes casually as if from personal observation.

---

## What He Added/Personalized

- White House origin story (genuine personal experience)
- Specific client anecdotes (billionaire with 8 Princeton-grad EAs)
- Freedom phone experiment
- Puerto Rico living context
- The specific Athena pricing ladder ($20/ChatGPT → $3k/Athena → $100k in-person)

---

**Bottom line**: Swanson's entire conceptual framework, historical examples, neuroscience framing, and even several exact phrases come directly from your manifesto. He essentially used it as his interview prep deck, sometimes nearly word-for-word.
