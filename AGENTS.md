## Files and Folders

- [Athena](https://www.athena.com/) is a premium executive assistant service.
- Athena clients are startup founders and executives, venture capitalists and other private equity personnel, larger-scale or rapidly scaling SMB entrepreneurs (often professional services like law, medicine and boutique consulting; real estate; bootstrapped SaaS; high-end "creators" e.g. `@thepediatricianmom`); mid-market and enterprise company executives or director+ level managers, etc).
- The purpose of this repo is to generate long-form content and supporting assets (e.g. D3 visualizations, Dagre and Mermaid Diagrams, genAI illustrations and other media, etc).
- This project uses Astro, DaisyUI, Tailwind V4, Bun, D3/Dagre, Mermaid, MDX, and Vercel AI SDK v6.
- Use the `grepapp` and `ref` CLI tools to get latest documentation.
- Use the `exa` CLI tool to get latest code context (i.e. current implementations) or answers (simple reponses to questions).
- `tailwind_templates/catalyst-ui-kit/` it the official Tailwind UI Kit and the preferred starting point for new styles, components, etc; it is a default theme intended to be duplicated from and then customized.
- `tailwind_templates/oatmeal-mist-instrument/` is the official Tailwind theme with specific styles, page layouts, and so on that we can copy from.
- The Oatmeal template is reasonably close to the Athena brand style, and can be used as a starting point for pages/styles/components, which can be adapted based on new design assets or the Athena style guide.
- The Athena style guide is at: `athena/brand/athena_com_style_guide.md`.
- The Athena brand voice guide is at: `athena/brand/athena_com_voice_and_copy.md`.
- The Athena website is [https://athena.com](https://athena.com).
- `athena/` contains information about the project's purpose; specifically the playbook generation.
- `maggie_appleton_components/` is a collection of well-designed Astro components.
- For testing, use `agent-browser`; see `docs/browser_cli_instructions.md`.
- All plans, product requirement documents, and specifications go in `specs/`, in appropriate subdirectories based on the status of the item.
- Verify all pages are error free yourself, without being asked by the user; keep checking the page with `agent-browser` and fixing issues until it is immaculate.
- Do not use emojis in code, output, or documentation. Unicode symbols (✓, ✗, →, ⚠) are acceptable.
- Refer to `docs/css_tricks_com_crafting_strong_dx_with_astro_components_and_typescript.md` for details on Astro and Typescript best practices.
- Refer to `.opencode/skill/daisyui/` for DaisyUI-specific best practices when writing any front-end file.
- Never use all caps for filenames or directory names or variables, unless strictly necessary (e.g. screaming snake case variable required in `.env` by a third-party library).
- Original/older playbook format: `athena/coda_playbooks_doc/CqI5pastxC.txt`
- Use `lower_snake_case` for every filename, directory name, etc.
- Strongly prefer Bun and avoid Node to the maximum extent possible. Always check Bun.com documentation for ways to avoid using Node or implement a feature with the latest Bun APIs, primitives, and syntax. Refactor any discovered Node usage to Bun immediately if encountered. Only utilize Node if multiple non-Node implementations were tried relentlessly and could not be implemented to success.
- There are demos for the component library listed here: `docs/demo_pages.md`; update regularly
- Documentation for the repo, its utilities, its workflows, its architecture, its runbooks, and so on live in `docs/` or subdirectories within.
- When making Mermaid diagrams, review `.opencode/skill/beautiful-mermaid/SKILL.md`
- When making Mermaid diagrams, consider: setting `htmlLabels: false` in config, settings `wrappingWidth` in config to override default, and using backtick syntax `["\text here\`"]`instead of`text<br/>here`
