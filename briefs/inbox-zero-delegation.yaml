  Achieving and maintaining Inbox Zero through strategic delegation to an executive
  assistant, without losing control of important communications.

  This playbook covers: establishing triage protocols (what the EA handles vs escalates);
  setting up label/folder systems and response templates; configuring delegation access
  (Gmail delegation, Superhuman team features, or shared inbox tools); training the EA
  on your communication style and priorities; and building feedback loops to improve
  accuracy over time.

  The system should handle: routine requests that can be declined or delegated; scheduling
  requests; information requests the EA can research and respond to; follow-up reminders;
  and flagging genuinely urgent items for immediate attention.

  Edge cases: VIP senders who always get through, confidential threads the EA shouldn't see,
  handling mistakes gracefully, and managing email during travel or intensive work periods.

persona:
  archetype: "Overwhelmed executive receiving 200+ emails daily"
  pain_points:
    - Spends 3+ hours daily on email, first thing in morning and last thing at night
    - Important messages buried under noise
    - Feels guilty about slow response times
    - Can't disconnect for a day without email anxiety
  goals:
    - Process email in 30 minutes or less daily
    - Never miss genuinely urgent or important messages
    - Respond to routine requests within 24 hours without personal involvement
    - Take a full day offline without stress

research_guidance:
  must_cover:
    - Gmail/Outlook delegation setup and best practices
    - Triage framework (4-quadrant or similar)
    - Response template library
    - VIP/priority sender lists
    - Weekly review process to tune accuracy
  do_not_cover:
    - Email marketing or newsletter management
    - Cold outreach strategies
    - Email client feature comparisons
  depth_guidance: "Tactical with specific examples - ready to implement this week"
  angles:
    - Trust-building with your EA (start small, expand scope)
    - Communication style documentation (so responses feel authentic)
    - Escalation protocols (never drop the ball on what matters)

section_hints:
  - Setting up delegation access securely
  - The triage framework (handle, delegate, escalate, archive)
  - Building your response template library
  - Training your EA on your voice and priorities
  - The weekly calibration meeting

delegation_focus: |
  This is a defensive delegation: the EA shields the client from noise while
  ensuring important items surface quickly.
  
  The EA handles: initial triage, routine responses, scheduling coordination, follow-ups.
  The client handles: strategic replies, relationship-critical threads, final decisions.
