The core problem: busy executives forget important dates, scramble last-minute for generic gifts, and feel guilty about dropped balls in relationships that matter. The solution: a proactive system where the EA monitors upcoming occasions, researches personalized gift options based on recipient preferences and history, presents curated choices, handles ordering and shipping, and tracks thank-you responses. Key workflows: one-time database setup with People/Gifts/Events tables, EA backfill from email receipts to populate gift history, recurring approval flow where EA presents 5 options and client replies with number 1-5, thank-you tracking to log reactions and improve future recommendations. Edge cases: international shipping requiring 6+ weeks lead time, corporate compliance limits on gift values, last-minute additions when client meets someone new. Success means: never missing an important date, receiving 'how did you know?' reactions from recipients, reclaiming 10+ hours per year previously spent on gift stress, and eliminating gift-related guilt entirely.",
  "research": "# Athena EA Delegation Playbook: Automating Gift-Giving\n\n## 1. Problem/Pain\n\nBusy executives often face significant challenges in managing gift-giving for important occasions. The core problem is that they frequently forget important dates, leading to last-minute scrambling for generic gifts and feelings of guilt due to missed opportunities in relationships that matter. This results in wasted time, stress, and potential damage to important relationships. The cost of not having a system includes:\n\n*   **Missed Dates:** Forgetting birthdays, anniversaries, and other significant events leads to missed opportunities to strengthen relationships.\n*   **Generic Gifts:** Last-minute gift choices are often impersonal and fail to convey thoughtfulness.\n*   **Time Drain:** The process of researching, selecting, ordering, and tracking gifts consumes valuable time that could be spent on higher-priority tasks.\n*   **Relationship Strain:** Inconsistent or thoughtless gift-giving can negatively impact relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.\n*   **Guilt and Stress:** The emotional burden of feeling unprepared and failing to show appreciation.\n\n## 2. Workflows\n\nThis section outlines the key workflows for automating gift-giving, detailing triggers, steps, owners (client vs. EA), and estimated time investments.\n\n### 2.1. Database Setup and Maintenance\n\n*   **Trigger:** Initial setup and ongoing maintenance.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Create Airtable Base:** Set up a new Airtable base to manage all gift-related information [Airtable Design Decisions Guide](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/airtable-design-decisions), [Create Your Database Guide](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/create-your-database).\n    2.  **Create Tables:** Create three core tables: People, Gifts, and Gift Events [Airtable Design Decisions Guide](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/airtable-design-decisions).\n        *   **People Table:** (Name, Relationship, Preferences, Important Dates).\n        *   **Gifts Table:** (What, When, Recipient, Reaction).\n        *   **Gift Events Table:** (Upcoming Occasions).\n    3.  **Link Records:** Establish relationships between tables using linked records [Airtable Design Decisions Guide](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/airtable-design-decisions).\n    4.  **Populate Gift History:** Backfill the Gifts table from email receipts (see Section 3.2).\n    5.  **Ongoing Maintenance:** Regularly update recipient preferences and important dates.\n*   **Owners:** EA (initial setup and ongoing maintenance).\n*   **Time Estimate:** Initial setup: a few hours to a day [Airtable Design Decisions Guide](https://www.airtable.com/guides/build/create-your-database). Ongoing maintenance: 1-2 hours per month.\n\n### 2.2. Automated Reminders and Gift Curation\n\n*   **Trigger:** 30-day reminder before an event [Airtable Automations Overview](https://www.airtable.com/platform/automations).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  **Set up Automation:** Create an Airtable automation triggered by a date field (e.g., event date) with a condition like",
