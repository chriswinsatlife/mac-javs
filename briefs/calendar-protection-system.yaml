  Protecting your calendar from meeting creep while ensuring you're available for
  what truly matters. A system for proactive time-blocking, meeting gatekeeping,
  and strategic scheduling delegation.

  This playbook covers: establishing non-negotiable time blocks (deep work, personal,
  weekly review); setting up a meeting request protocol where the EA screens and
  qualifies before anything hits your calendar; configuring scheduling tools like
  Calendly or SavvyCal with proper constraints; batch scheduling to cluster meetings
  on specific days; and running effective calendar audits to reclaim time.

  The system should handle: external meeting requests, internal meeting invites,
  rescheduling coordination, time zone complexity, and buffer time enforcement.

  Edge cases: truly urgent requests that should interrupt deep work, managing a
  CEO or board member who ignores your system, double-bookings, and travel scheduling.

persona:
  archetype: "VC partner or executive with back-to-back meetings and no time to think"
  pain_points:
    - Calendar is 80%+ meetings, no time for deep work
    - Anyone can book time, no gatekeeper
    - Constantly context-switching between unrelated meetings
    - Dreads Monday because the week is already packed
  goals:
    - Protect 2+ hours of uninterrupted deep work daily
    - Reduce total meeting hours by 30% without damaging relationships
    - Cluster meetings to create focus days
    - Review the week ahead every Sunday with confidence

  must_cover:
    - Time-blocking methodology (maker vs manager schedule)
    - Meeting request qualification framework
    - Scheduling tool setup with proper constraints
    - Calendar audit process
    - The EA as calendar gatekeeper role
  do_not_cover:
    - Meeting facilitation or agenda best practices
    - Specific meeting productivity tips (that's after they're scheduled)
    - Time tracking software
  depth_guidance: "Strategic with specific implementation steps"
  angles:
    - Defense (protecting time) and offense (proactively scheduling what matters)
    - The political art of saying no gracefully
    - Building meeting-free zones that others respect

section_hints:
  - Designing your ideal week (time blocks and meeting clusters)
  - The meeting request protocol (who qualifies, what questions to ask)
  - Setting up your scheduling tool with proper guardrails
  - Running a calendar audit (what to cut, combine, or delegate)
  - The weekly calendar review ritual

delegation_focus: |
  This is a defensive-offensive delegation: the EA both protects existing blocks
  and proactively schedules high-priority items the client is avoiding.
  
  The EA handles: screening requests, scheduling logistics, rescheduling, buffer enforcement.
  The client handles: final approval on new commitments, protected block exceptions.
