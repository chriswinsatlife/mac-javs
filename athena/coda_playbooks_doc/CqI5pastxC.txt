Overview


Playbook Design

Background



Purpose

The purpose of the playbook document is to:

* Get the client excited about something they can delegate or automate
* Make it clear what other top delegators are doing in an area where they might have low visibility
* Help them understand the value of turning on this particular delegation
* Provide clear instructions to the client on what they have to do
* Provide clear instructions to the EA on what they have to do
* Segment the instructions into the setup and the ongoing workflows

Format

Requirements

* Playbook content
  * Title
  * Subtitle
  * Intro / lede to create motivation
    * Possible setups: “Why this is important”, “How you’ll benefit”, etc
  * Author 
    * Can be individual or organization
  * Tags
    * Early stage founder, angel investor, etc
  * Area
    * Personal finance, marketing, admin, etc
  * Tools
    * Airtable, Zapier, Superhuman, etc
  * Templates
    * E.g. copy this Notion page
  * Content
    * Client-facing content
      * Benefits, quick note from originator, etc
    * EA-facing content
      * Detailed instructions, SOPs, FAQs, etc
  * Other Ideas
    * Maybe a before and after 
      * E.g. 10h + panic every time a gift event comes up vs “let’s go with option #2”
    * Maybe total time savings per week / month / year / lifetime
    * Maybe a pull quote or testimonial, or a quote on the importance of the subject area



* Hero image
  * Screenshot or image showing the results or benefits of the playbook (e.g. here), and approximately how the playbook or process works
    * May be a diagram or an Airtable or a visual representation of what success or results look like
    * Aim for simplicity and emphasizing benefits, rather than comprehensively documenting workflow
* Templates
  * Generally going to be Airtable, may also link to other services like Clay or Zapier
  * Where possible, e.g. with Notion/Airtable/Zapier, it should be easy to duplicate/copy the template to the client’s individual workspace (typically done by the EA)
  * Ideally, the workflows should be app agnostic (i.e. can work with any similar app vs. being idiosyncratic to a single product’s functionality, where possible)
    * E.g., If a client uses Asana or Todoist or Clickup, the playbook should generally work regardless
* Links to related playbooks
  * Self-explanatory
* Feedback
  * A way for them to make suggestions or recommend improvements or share their implementation for review w the Athena team; more at the implementation level than individual document level

Nice to Have

* Button
  * Some kind of single-click action to add the creation/implementation playbook to the EA’s task list, either via email / message / Asana / etc
* Who the playbook is used by
  * If privacy is an issue, we can consider things like: VC @ FirmName, YC-backed Founder, etc
* Who a playbook is inspired by or influenced by
  * E.g. Peter Boyce CRM from Superorganizers article
  * Useful to 1) encourage internal sharing of playbooks from clients (e.g. “your playbook is the most copied this month”), 2) drive uptake social proof (i.e. “I want to do my personal CRM like Jonathan / Naval / etc”), and 3) create marketing opportunities
* Configuration options
  * App choices
    * E.g. doing calendar in Vimcal vs. Cron
  * Client preferences & alternative processes
    * E.g. do weekly review with EA on live call, async via document, async via Loom or voice note, etc
  * Data sources & use cases
    * E.g. if you're setting up a CRM, based on where your data is stored, there may be different places to scrape or integrate data (some clients may want LinkedIn data but not Crunchbase)
    * This can get endlessly complicated so important to keep simple for V1
* References
  * Links to articles that we reviewed as part of making the playbook

Playbook Strategy



Context

When considering and prioritizing playbooks, we might assess their benefits in a variety of areas. Depending on near-term business priorities, the playbook team could focus on a single area vs. aiming for a portfolio approach.

Benefits

Playbooks can serve different roles, including:

* Activation
  * When playbooks enable quicker time-to-benefit for new clients, or create infrastructure that enables more frequent or more proactive delegation, we’ll be less likely to see churn in M1-M3
* Retention
  * Fairly obvious; the more a playbook enables repeat delegation or a greater surface area of business/life delegation, the greater dependency on the Athena platform
* Revenue Expansion
  * Playbooks emphasizing multiplayer use throughout the organization can lead to more seats/EAs, as can super valuable playbooks that ramp up EA time and trigger plan upgrades
  * A playbook can be the first foray or test MVP around a potentially new service offering, like chief of staff or highly-specialized EAs (e.g. venture capital analyst)
* Growth
  * Referrals
    * Certain playbooks are likely to have a strong word-of-mouth factor, especially those involving external relationships
  * Virality
    * Many playbooks can be made into cornerstone content for public content marketing, e.g. CRM
    * Partnering with clients to help formalize/share their playbooks can be a strong way to juice referrals (e.g. if they share the playbook we polished/expanded with them via social)
    * Playbook-like content, e.g. podcast interviews with Athena clients, can serve a similar purpose even in the absence of an associated playbook
    * Partnering on content with tools used in playbooks, especially less popular ones, can be a source of traffic (e.g. work on a company blog post for Clay, Descript, etc)
    * Similar idea applies for venture firms (e.g. First Round Capital’s posts with Sam Corcos) or media platforms around productivity, management, startups, etc

Timeblocking with EA + AI



This is a V1 and not ready for sharing yet. 



---



Context

Timeblocking is an incredibly effective strategy for prioritizing the important things in your business and personal life. Unfortunately, it’s extremely time-consuming and hard to set high-level ‘rules’ for your time, even if you have an EA to help. Moreover, things happen and rescheduling is ultimately inevitable. 

Thankfully, tools like Reclaim, Clockwise, and Motion exist to help augment time management with AI. Leveraging these with your EA—i.e. working with your EA to set and manage the auto-scheduling rules—is a super powerful system to ensure your time is well-spent. Moreover, it saves your EA a good amount of time by automating the tedious parts, so you can leverage them for higher complexity tasks. It's a win-win, and after a couple weeks of tweaking the rules, you’ll likely never go back to manual planning.



Strategy

* Align with EA on ideal time splits as percentages, e.g. between projects, work areas like sales vs. product, time with certain people, time spent fitness or learning, etc
* Set up Reclaim list of automated timeblocks & have EA create ‘habits’ with appropriate logic
* Sync Google Calendars with Airtable to enable easier tracking/reporting (e.g. % time in meetings vs not)
* Track manual changes to the schedule necessitated by urgent commitments
* Leverage ‘tasks’ to timeblock specific items with an end date—e.g. 10 hours on X in 1h+ chunks over the next 6 weeks
* Review time spent weekly / monthly and adjust intentions—don’t worry about getting it perfect to start



---

Checklist

[ ] Review previous month / quarter and set ideal time splits as percentages (simple)
[ ] Draft V1 timeblocks with basic logic for EA to set up in Reclaim
  [ ] Recommend adding a 1-2h block for ‘admin,’ which includes things like email processing, Slack, and handling emergent minor tasks
  [ ] Recommend using a specific split of categories for work tasks, e.g. investor relations, product, sales, marketing, recruiting, etc and/or a set of time for particularly large milestones, e.g. next major feature, planning new GTM channel, etc
  [ ] Recommend categories for high-priority personal areas, like fitness, reading, mental health, family time, pet projects, friends, time in nature, etc
  [ ] Recommend 1h time for reviewing previous tasks, time spent, and delegated tasks in order to iteratively improve the system
  [ ] Consider timeblocks for ‘undesirable’ behaviors as a strategy to limit inadvertent time spend (e.g. social media, etc)
  [ ] Indicate which timeblocks you’re comfortable with your EA scheduling over or moving from their standard time
[ ] Create & purchase premium Reclaim AI account
[ ] Have your EA set up the timeblocks following the system below
[ ] Have your EA set a reminder 2 weeks after starting the timeblocking playbook for you to leave a voice note assessing your experience (to share with the Athena team and make improvements to your own implementation)

Timeblocks (”Habits” in Reclaim)

Notes: 

* If you schedule over a Reclaim-created event or delete it, it will reschedule itself later in the day/week using the same logic you originally specified (if possible, given the rest of the schedule)
* If Reclaim finds events with certain text that you provide in “Avoid Duplicate Events Keywords”, it will skip that events recurrence—super helpful and a good idea to use this feature
* Each individual ‘habit’ (timeblock) can be prioritize above or below ‘tasks’, which are multi-day timeblocks provided with certain logic (e.g. block 10 hours during working hours over the next month to work on the GTM strategy deck)
* The hashtag is used in event titles to power other automations, such as adding related tasks via Zapier or Airtable for analyzing your time in reports
* The “🛡” indicates the event is owned by Reclaim and other people cannot schedule over it; the “🆓” block means it’s on your calendar but other people cannot see it, so they can schedule over it

Tasks

These enable you to block a certain number of hours by a certain date for a large task that requires multiple work sessions. This is a very powerful feature, especially since it’s easy to prioritize these above or below your other habits/timeblocks in a very granular fashion.



For example, you can say:

“Schedule 10 hours over the next 4 weeks to work on the GTM strategy deck, in 1-2 hour chunks, except on Wednesdays. Higher priority than fundraising timeblock but lower than gym.”



A good practice is to review your calendar once a week, and then ask your EA to add a task with sufficient details for major work items that you’d like to prioritize. 



Open Tasks in Reclaim

EA Steps

* Send to EA button
* Loom/Tango/etc goes here



---





V2 Enhancements

* Task blocking automation
  * Create Zapier or Airtable to append highest-priority items in given task list or tag set to appropriate timeblock, e.g.
    * #startupname tagged tasks in Asana or Todoist with priority:high get added to weekly #startupname or #deepwork time block for focused work
    * #sales tagged tasks get added to #sales timeblock
    * #gym timeblock gets latest workout programmed by the trainer
    * etc
* Fancier report
  * Time spent in various sub-domains or priorities, paired with # tasks done or # tasks delegated in the same areas as part of a monthly/quarterly report
* Task enhancement automation
  * Pull tasks related to projects or areas (e.g. marketing, product, etc) and ping GPT-3 to suggest a set of steps to execute it (or how you can delegate parts of it to your EA)
* CRM integration
  * Use 1-on-1 feature to schedule time automatically with other people, not just timeblock yourself; use this with the personal CRM
* Variable timeblocking based on Nylas or other bespoke coded solution


Invoicing Playbook

Why This is Important

We need to be able to get paid, or else we can’t run our business. 



Invoicing Instructions

This Cognitive Invoicing Airtable is set up with all the info you need.

Cognitive, LLC is the name of the legal entity/company that I own which sends the invoices.

Here's what we need to do:

1. For each client, a day or two before their Invoice Send date, email or WhatsApp me confirming the client + invoice amount
  * This is important because the amount per month may change; right now, Riva is on $20k / month on the 6th of each month
2. If I confirm the invoice should be sent:
  1. Go into the Airtable and hit "Preview Invoice," or just go under "Apps" and print the invoice to PDF; make sure it's for the right date/client
  2. Click the button for "Draft email," or just copy/paste the email text into an email and send to the "Client Invoice Email" listed and CC me @ c@chrisyork.co
  3. Update the Airtable's row to "Sent & Unpaid"
  4. Next, check Mercury Bank (using LastPass login) to verify the client has paid all outstanding invoices
    * If they have outstanding invoices, reply to the email (or send a new one) asking when they plan on paying it and CC me @ c@chrisyork.co
    * Message me and ask how often or aggressively to follow up with the late clients
3. If the invoice should not be sent, I will probably explain why, and we should update the Airtable accordingly (e.g. change client status to "Inactive" on "Clients" tab or update contract details)
Internal Friends & Family Gifting Setup

Why This is Important

Worry less about remembering birthdays and stop always buying gifts at the last minute.



Buying Gifts Instructions

During Christmas, I added everyone's gifts to this Airtable, along with sources I looked at for gift ideas, and other helpful info. Right now, it's only fully complete for family and last year (excluding birthdays and Mother's Day). 

For 2021, the main place to look first is the "Gift Events" tab. 

You have my Airtable login via LastPass now and can just log into it as me, but if you prefer, I can share your email on that Airtable base.

 

What I'd like your help with:

1. Check this Airtable every ~1-2 weeks on the "Gifts Event" tab
2. If it's around the time to start looking for gifts (this is auto-generated in Airtable), then:
  1. Review what we bought them last time ("Gifts")
  2. Check "Sources" based on their "Interests" for gift ideas
  3. Email me 5-10 gift ideas with links / prices
3. Once we decide what to buy people:
  1. Buy it and send it to their address (Use chase sapphire reserve card)
  2. Pre-draft a message for them w/ the estimated arrival date(s); 
    1. For now, send this to me on WhatsApp and I'll send this via iMessage since I'm not sure how to give you my iMessage/Apple ID login yet.
  3. Add the gift to "Gifts" tab for record-keeping
  4. Update the "Gift Events" tab
  5. Add the place we bought it and brand to the "Brands & Stores" tab

Exporting LinkedIn Contacts



In LinkedIn, you can export your connections’ full name, email address, current employer, and job title. It even tells you when your connection with that particular individual began. That’s the foundation for an excellent database—one you can later segment by company, industry (if you know the companies well enough), or position level.



1. Access Your Connections in LinkedIn

Navigate to My Network at the top of your LinkedIn. Once inside your network, click My Connections on the left side bar.

Your LinkedIn contacts live under My Network.

2. Manage Your Contacts

Click Manage Synced and Imported Contacts on the right side of your screen. This one is almost hidden. You’ll find it in light grey, which is a little hard to read.

Almost hidden, you

3. Export Your Contacts

Under Advanced Actions on the right, click Export Contacts.

Under Advanced actions, Export contacts.



Under How LinkedIn uses your data, select Connections, then click Request Archive. You may need to re-enter your email address to download your contacts. Just a heads up, it may take a minute to receive your connections.

How LinkedIn uses your data, choose who you want to export.




Exporting Phone Contacts

Apple Users: How to Sync iPhone Contacts to Google Contacts

Alternatively, if you want to sync your contacts between your phone and an associated email address, do the following:

* Open Settings
* Tap Accounts & Passwords
* Select the email address you wish to sync

If you have multiple accounts on your iPhone, select the email you want to sync.

* Ensure Contacts is turned on

Turn on Contacts for this account.

Android Users: How To Sync Contacts to Google Contacts

On most Android devices, your contacts automatically sync when you turn on your phone and sign in to your Google Account for the first time.

That means you don't need to export from Android—you only need to ensure your Android contacts are still syncing to Google Contacts. Just sync your contacts to your Google Contacts account and export from Google Contacts.

Here's how to double-check your contact sync:

1. Open Settings
2. Open Accounts and Sync
3. Tap your Google account
4. Slide the "Contacts" button to the "On" position
5. Press Sync Now

Now when you sign into Google Contacts, you should see your Android contacts stored. To export them, follow the steps listed above on How to Export Contacts from Google Contacts.

Apple/iPhone Users: How To Export Contacts from Your iCloud

If you have a Mac or iPhone, the simplest way to export your contacts is online through iCloud.

* Sign into iCloud.com. If you’re already signed-in on your computer, skip to step two
* Navigate to Contacts
* In the bottom left corner, click the settings icon
* Click on Select All from the dropdown

Select all your iCloud contacts.

* Once all contacts are selected, select Export vCard
* Save your .VCF file on your computer

Apple Users: How to Import iCloud Contacts into Gmail

While you can export your contacts from these lists, they’re not exported as a CSV file. Instead, each contact is exported as a "vCard." The simplest way to convert VCF to CSV is to simply import them into your email, then export them back out as CSV.

* Open Google Contacts
* Select Import Contacts on the left side bar

Import Contacts into Gmail easily.

* Select your .VCF file from your computer

Select your file and Import those contacts.

* Click Import

Then, repeat the export process by selecting the group you just imported, instead of All Contacts, like before.

Select the group you imported and get those exported for use in Excel.

Playbook Outline

Call agenda management



Preferred Tool:

  Hugo - Hugo’s provides Action Item Tracking and Agenda Management inside meetings. Also has an integration with Zoom that immediately attaches recordings to meeting notes. 

  Alternative: Fellow - Very similar features to Hugo and a little bit easier to use and set-up but I feel Hugo’s additional integrations + ease of automation setup with Zapier for call agenda management gives it the edge.

Call transcription tools

Preferred Tool:

  Fireflies - Found all the transcription tools very good but Fireflies/Descript is preferred they are are well-integrated with Zapier. I believe I can also set-up an automation with Hugo > Fireflies/Descript to automatically upload and transcribe recordings.

  Afterwards, another automation can be set up in Zapier to automate uploading of transcription to whichever document SaaS the client prefers. 

  Can set up separate automations or clients can choose to pay for the higher tier Zapier plan to create multiple triggers and actions.

  Alternative: Descript - While Descript is also pretty good, I think the Gcal integration and instant recording + transcription of Fireflies is too good to pass up. Plus their app is very simple and easy to use.

Note: If you have a Zoom Pro, Business, or Enterprise account, you can use the Zoom integration to instantly use cloud recordings instead of adding Fireflies as participant.

Action Item Creation



Preferred Tool: Depends on Client-EA setup.

EA manually moves action items created in Hugo + additional action items found in transcript to their To-Do List of choice (Ticktick, Asana, etc.) and assigns to appropriate owner (EA or client). 

Alternatively, sends an email summary of action items.

Client Setup:



Hugo

1. Sign up for Hugo (free) and install the extension.
2. Hugo automatically integrates to your Gcal / Microsoft 365 account to pull up your calendar.
3. Enable the Zoom integration
4. Done! If you are using a web browser to join meetings, you can just click on the Hugo extension to open 



Hugo will automatically detect Zoom links and enables you to join the Zoom meeting from Hugo using the "Join Call" button.  The Zoom for Hugo integration connects cloud recordings and transcripts of your meetings to your meeting docs, ensuring that insights and takeaways are shared with relevant teammates and easy to locate in the future

Fireflies

1. Sign up for Fireflies (Pro Plan) and install the extension.
2. Enable the Zoom (audio-recording) integration
3. On the homepage, make sure to set your meeting settings to: “Join all cal-events with web-conf link”

image.png

Alternatively, you can invite fred@fireflies.ai to your meetings as a participant, or add the AI to a specific meeting by turning on the radio button on the home page. 

image.png

Transcripts will be automatically created and stored on your Fireflies Notebook when a Zoom cloud recorded meeting ends.





EA Setup:

1. Create or sign in to your client’s Zapier account.
2. Create a copy of this Zap



EA Playbook:

1. Once your client finishes a meeting, open Hugo and get all the Action Items listed in the meeting notes. 
2. The zap you created should automatically send the transcript to client’s preferred document SaaS (Notion, Coda, etc.)
3. 
Gift Automation Playbook

Context

* Elite delegators strengthen their relationships with automated thoughtfulness. 
* Top Athenians spend less than 30 seconds on average per gift purchase. 
* They give better gifts too, since these gifts are pattern-matched off the gift recipient and gift giver’s historical data, plus top gifts across the Athena client base. 

Benefits

* Several hours per year saved
* More thoughtful gifts and happier recipients
* Freed mental bandwidth from remembering special dates and gift obligations
* Reduced chance of last-minute panic or forgotten gift events
* Can scale gift-giving to more people, which can improve friendships and network

What Elite Gift Giving Looks Like

* 30 days before any gift event, like Mother’s Day, holidays, or birthdays, your EA will send you 5 gift ideas for the person you care about
* You’ll respond with a number 1-5 about 95% of the time, or a request for more options with new direction
* The gift will show up at the right time, and you’ll get a very excited text message

---

Playbook Setup

1. Copy the Gift Automation Airtable Template (2 seconds)
  1. Duplicate the records, since the “Sources” tab will be useful for EAs
  2. CMD+A and delete all records on the “People” tab once you get the basic idea
2. Add people who are important to you 
  1. Req’d: Names, birthdays, and anniversaries 
    1. Year can be approximate for birthdays, but age is a factor for EA gift selection
  2. Optional: Addresses, contact info, clothing sizes, gift value, notes 
    1. EA can look some of these up (e.g. average value of past gifts)
3. Check the boxes for which people get which gifts; feel free to add columns for other dates or holidays
4. Share with your EA, who will do the rest 🚀



Optional Additions

* Tell EA if you’d like to modify the playbook defaults: 
  * Lead time (default is 30 days), 
  * Number of gift ideas (default is 5), 
  * Different message medium (default is email)
  * If you’d like to CC someone to help with gift decisions (e.g. like significant other)
* Send your EA a voice note describing people’s interests or gifts they’ve liked in the past
* Add your favorite sites for gift discovery to the “Sources” tab and brands to the “Brands & Stores” tab, or voice note to your EA (sometimes these can be hard to spell or make out from audio on voice notes)



Bonus

* If you have ideas to improve this playbook, voice note your EA to share it with the playbook team

EA Playbook

Clients: Feel free to ignore this, or copy the doc + edit if you like fine-grained control over the process



Populating Gift History

1. Open the client’s Gift Automation Airtable
2. Delete any fake data 
3. Go to the Airtable’s “People” tab
4. For each person on the tab:
  1. Search for each person’s name in quotes, along with phrases like “shipping,” “tracking,” the first line of the person’s address in quotes, etc (one at a time)
    1. An example would be “Denise Herrera” “tracking”
  2. For each purchase receipt or tracking number email, check if it’s likely to be a gift based on how close it is to birthday, anniversary date, etc and add it to the “Gifts” tab
    1. Sometimes people buy things as a favor (e.g. bought grandma vitamins because she struggles with Amazon) or have things shipped to their mom’s house when they’re visiting; be careful
    2. Don’t add things to the Airtable unless the shipment was clearly around a birthday or holiday, or clearly a gift item based on how thoughtful/valuable it is
  3. For each gift the person received, add it to the “Gifts” tab and fill out the columns
    1. Fill in all gifts for each person for at least the past 3 years (5 if you have free time)



Setting up the Gift Events Tab

1. For each person-event combo, add a new row to the “Gift Events” tab
  1. E.g. Mother’s Day 2021 for mom/significant other/grandmother is 3 rows
  2. After filling in the details, the “Start Looking for Gifts” should populate
    1. Modify this formula if the client asked to change the lead time; change “30” to however many days
2. Set a calendar event or create an Asana task with the appropriate date for each gift event, using the “Start Looking for Gifts” date and the name of the person-event combo
  1. Do not mark the event as complete until the gift is bought; doing this simply after sending an email with gift ideas is a good way to accidentally forget someone’s gift
3. Add new gift ideas you find or hear about from other EAs to the “Gifts” tab as ideas



Gift Tab Maintenance

1. Each year, create the full set of person-event combos like last time
2. Every year or 6 months, ask if there are any friends or business connections we’d like to add to our gifting practice, or if there are other events for existing people (e.g. anniversary of a company’s founding)
  1. As a bonus, provide some specific people or event ideas based on what you know about their communication and scheduling practices



Preparing a Gift Idea Message

1. When the “Start Searching for Gift Day” arrives, open the Airtable to the person and review their previous gifts to get a sense of what might be appropriate (and avoid suggesting things that they already have)
  1. If the client has not provided a price range for a given person and you can’t estimate this from past gifts, tell them you’ll plan to start searching today for items around $150-200 unless they’d like to find cheaper/more inexpensive gifts
2. Find 5 different gifts that are generally within the price range (25% more or less is usually fine), and add these to the “Gifts” Airtable with the Status label “Idea” 
  1. You can also buy multiple things that together equal the right price, e.g. 3 skincare products that are $50 each for a person with a $150 gift price range
3. Draft an email to your client on the appropriate gift, titled something like “5 {Event Name} Gift Ideas for {Person First Name}”
4. For each gift idea, always include:
  1. Number
  2. Image
  3. Name
  4. URL
  5. Price
  6. 1-2 sentences of details which are most relevant (don’t copy a full paragraph from the item description)
  7. If you found it from a curated list, include where it’s from (e.g. “Wirecutter’s #1 recommended weighted blanket” or “From the Strategist’s top 10 recs for millennial mom self-care products”)
5. At the end, ask if there are similar people who we can use a previous gift for (e.g. if we sent friend X a certain gift, we can send the same thing to friend Y if they have very similar taste or interests)
6. Let them know you will follow-up in a week if you don’t hear back from them



Gift Idea Message Follow-Up

1. If you don’t receive a response within a week, send a reminder to the client
    1. Ask them if they’d like to choose an option, have you just pick one (include which one you’d pick in this email), or have you provide more gift ideas
    2. Note: Some gifts may take 2+ weeks due to shipping, and it’s important not to be late (clients will often be busy and forget these kind of emails)
2. If you don’t receive a response within another ~3 business days, send another reminder



Gift Confirmation

1. When the client responds and indicates a gift idea is selected, send an email to confirm that the gift is bought and on the way
2. Always include
  1. The card used
  2. The total price, including shipping
  3. Whether there was special wrapping (always do this for Amazon, if available)
  4. The expected date of delivery 
    1. By default, have it arrive a few days early in case of shipping delays unless it’s a food item or a reliable delivery product like flowers on Mother’s Day
  5. The tracking number and shipping company
3. Ask the client: 
    1. If they’d like the tracking number to be sent to the recipient
      1. This can vary if they’d like to keep surprise or help someone ensure they receive it, e.g. if they have to check in their condominium building’s mailroom
    2. If you should confirm with the recipient that they’ve received the package
      1. Some clients may prefer to do this themselves
      2. This can be done by you contacting them personally as their EA, pre-drafting a message from the client, or sending a message on the client’s behalf (e.g. if you have access to their WhatsApp)
    3. To let you know if you can improve anything about the process for the next gift. 



Tips

* If your client has an Airtable Pro Plan, you can use the web clipper app to more efficiently add gift ideas to the Airtable as you browse in Chrome.
* If you have a hard time, ask other EAs on Slack what popular gifts are for people with similar background (which you can get from the Airtable)




Travel Database Playbook

Separate sections for flights, non-flight travel (e.g. trains, cruises), hotels/Airbnbs, rental car or car services, and destinations (e.g. restaurants, co-working, gyms, spas, cafes, tourist destinations, etc.)



Playbook Setup

1. Copy the Travel Management Airtable Template (2 seconds)
  1. Duplicate the records, since the “Sites” tab will be useful for EAs
  2. CMD+A and delete all records on the other tabs once you get the basic idea
2. In the ‘Cities’ tab, add the cities you will be travelling to
  1. Feel free to add as many cities as you want, even if you are unsure if you’ll be travelling there
3. Share with your EA, who will do the rest 🚀



EA Playbook

Clients: Feel free to ignore this, or copy the doc + edit if you like fine-grained control over the process



Flights

1. One-time, collect client preferences on 
  1. aisle vs window seats, 
  2. front/back of plane, 
  3. economy vs economy plus vs business vs first class as default
  4. exit row vs none exit row
  5. time/travel distance to airport
  6. layover times, etc.
  7. meals
  8. airline points vs cash ( https://thepointsguy.com/) 
2. Collect client preference on default payment method
3. Decide on researching cash vs. points vs. both 
  1. If points, search on Awardhacker w/ the loyalty points program and airline for the client, and establish the points cost vs. TPG valuation
  2. If cash:
    1. If one way, check FlightList (maybe check it regardless, since you can also do 2 one-ways)
    2. Check Skiplagged, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Momondo
    3. Check rewards flight booking on Chase, AMEX, etc. as relevant
  3. OPTIONAL: For complex itineraries, see if FlightFox can beat the best price we found, which usually doesn’t cost much and I believe is free if they fail.
4. Add options to Flights tab in Airtable and share view to client, or just book it, based on their preferences.



Non-air travel (e.g. boats and trains)

1. For non-air travel, e.g. boats and trains:
  1. Rome2Rio is the best generally.
  2. For cruises specifically, CruiseSheet is the best option.



Rental Cars

1. Similar to hotels; collect car-related preferences and then points vs. cash per trip
2. For US, consider Turo, GetAround, and SilverCar in addition to traditional car rental agencies
3. Search for points deals using Chase, Amex, etc portals
4. Search car rental agencies using CarRentals.com (http://carrentals.com/)



For Hotels & Airbnb

* Collect general preferences for hotel vs Airbnb, price ranges, neighborhoods, etc



Hotels

1.  Collect preferences on required features (e.g. gym, etc) for short and long stays
2.  Decide on points vs. cash on per-trip basis
3.  Search hidden rate sites like Hotwire & Priceline using RoomRevealer
4.  If using points, find best hotels in relevant programs using AwardMapper (https://www.awardmapper.com/) and look up rates for transferring e.g. Chase or AMEX points 
  1.  Search within the rewards portals for their loyalty programs and preferred hotel brands (often the hotels themselves have cheaper rates than e.g. Chase)
5.  Search booking.com, hotels.com, etc
6. Use https://roomrevealer.com/#filterz to unlock Hotwire.com / Priceline.com deals



Tips

* If your client has an Airtable Pro Plan, you can use the web clipper app to more efficiently add travel recommendations to the Airtable as you browse in Chrome

Recruiting & JD Creation Playbook

Context

Recruitment, while being one of the most critical tasks of a startup, is also one of the most challenging and tedious processes to set up. Since most are starting from scratch, most startups don’t have a proper and complete hiring process that helps in identifying the best candidates that fit your organization’s identity and culture, while at the same time ensuring they are competent in their roles. Other than hiring new employees, recruiting is also definitely a form of publicity and marketing strategy. 

Fortunately, we can leverage our EA and enrichment tools like Clay to scrape candidates that fit your organization’s criteria from sites like LinkedIn. Afterwards, we use Airtable and OpenAI’s powerful GPT-3 model to automate intro email creation. Using OpenAI’s API, we can also generate job descriptions that are relevant to your organization/hiring target.

Strategy

* Align with EA on your hiring target (Product directors, lead designers, etc.)
* Provide list of companies where you want to scrape leads from (or provide EA with a general idea:  i.e. all healthcare companies on LinkedIn)
* Setup relevant accounts (Clay, Airtable, OpenAI)
* Contact qualified leads from your Clay → Airtable scrape using the AI generated intro emails.
* Post AI-generated JD to relevant job boards 



---

Checklist

[ ] Draft V1 list of companies you want to enrich and scrape (i.e. ‘All US healthcare companies on LinkedIn’)
[ ] Create and purchase Clay Pro plan
[ ] Create and purchase Airtable Pro plan
[ ] Create OpenAI account and setup API key
[ ] Have EA set up Clay table for enriching your company list & scraping LI profiles.
[ ] Have EA export to Airtable and set up OpenAI scripting block and filters.
[ ] Have EA review AI-generated results and adjust OpenAI prompt as needed. 
[ ] Give EA access to your email and have them send intro emails as you
[ ] Have EA post OpenAI generated JD to job boards relevant to your hiring target (Pallet, DemandCurve, AshbyHQ, Y-Combinator,  BeforeYouApply, etc.)

Nutrition Optimization

Goal

* Food and supplements perfectly aligned with your individual nutritional deficiencies appear in your house, effortlessly (via personal chef + expert-vetted dietetics advice)

How it works

* Based on the recommendations of a nutritional sciences PhD, we’ve created a comprehensive list of labs for optimizing nutrition, addressing micronutrient deficiencies, and reducing a variety of nagging health problems
* Your EA will schedule these in the lowest-friction way possible, and use the results to generate a personalized list of supplement recommendations from top vendors alongside detailed meal planning instructions for a personal chef, based on your specific micronutrient deficiencies
* Food and supplements will show up in your house, making it as effortless as possible to improve any biomarkers where you have room for leverage (you get final approval on menu choices, of course)

Client Setup Steps

* If you have any special labs you’d like to add (e.g. for a health condition you might have), let your EA know
* Leave a voice note saying you’d like to start the nutrition optimization playbook
  * Mention any preferences around lab scheduling; unfortunately there are likely 2-3 separate visits required but these are relatively quick and can often be bundled in the same day
* That’s it ⚡️

EA Playbook



Phase 1: Test Scheduling

* Copy the Lab Testing & Nutrition Optimization Airtable
* Go to the Test Groups tab and find the nearest locations for each test for your client
* Schedule the labs on the same day, if possible, respecting your client’s calendar preferences
* Create calendar events for the labs, accounting for travel time to and from
* Schedule Ubers etc



Phase 2: Test Interpretation & Action Items

* When the lab result emails arrive, download the PDFs to a Dropbox folder
* Open the labs Airtable
* On the Events tab, add a new event for each day the client obtained labs
* On the Results tab, add the values for each lab from the PDFs
* On the Interpretation tab, you’ll see a filtered list of labs with recommended action items
* Generate the PDF for this report, and send it to the client; notify them that your plan is to relay the nutritional action items to the meal planner/chef and buy the recommended supplements; also offer to schedule a labs interpretation call with Dr. Masterjohn or another whitelisted expert
  * If the client doesn’t have a chef and wants one, consult the Vetted Service Provider Hiring Playbook
  * If the client prefers a meal delivery service, consult our Recommended Meal Delivery Services and request/select options that conform to the foods recommended to address micronutrient deficiencies
* Generate the PDF instructions for the meal planner/chef, and request a proposed menu be sent to the client and yourself for approval



Phase 3: Iteration

* Estimate the date of each supplement refill based on the recommended dosage and bottle contents; schedule an email to the client two weeks before this date saying you plan to order a refill in a week unless they would prefer to stop; set up automated purchase/delivery if the client prefers
* After 3 months, ask if the client would like to reschedule labs to see if diet and supplement interventions were effective in improving biomarkers; if they decline, ask again after 6 months
* Re-run the playbook as required 
  * Recommended every 6 months or 1 year, unless the client is managing a health condition more aggressively or prefers tighter frequency
Inbox Management

Your mission as an EA is to advance through this progression as fast or as slowly as your client is comfortable. Some clients may not want to give access to their email on day 1, so you can start with reactive support by encouraging your client to just forward you any emails you can help with. Other clients will be excited to jump in all the way immediately, and you can start sorting, archiving, and drafting emails from the start. 

Your goal is to:

1. Do what feels comfortable for the client but also
2. Nudge the client further along the playbook progression over time so you help them in deeper and deeper ways.

Reactive Support

Client Forwards Emails

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. Your client just needs to start forwarding you emails (no email access needed)
2. Step 1: Encourage your client to start forwarding you any emails you can help with. Examples: RSVPs, bills to pay, forms to fill out, etc. You want to train your client to always think “can my EA help with this?” before tackling an email themself.
3. Step 2: Continue encouraging your client to send you more and more types of emails so you help in more and more ways. Also, when the time is right, encourage your client to give you access to their email so you can tackle the more complex playbooks below.

Proactive Support

Classifying Email Messages

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email. The client should create an email for EA in the same domain, or else use the EA’s personal email address. Here’s how to set up email delegation on Gmail, and here’s how to do it on Outlook.
2. The client should inform you how he wants his emails to be classified, either by label or color coding, or both.
  1. Give you a list of labels to be used, or the legend of the colors that he wants to be used.
    1. Sample labels can include:
      * Urgent - emails which need immediate response or those which contain info that stakeholder must know of immediately
      * Please handle - emails which the EA does not have context of and is best handled by the client
      * FYI - emails that do not require any action
    2. Sample color codes:
      * Yellow - Urgent
      * Blue - Please Handle
      * Green - FYI

Step 1: Using your delegated access, go to the “inbox” of your client’s email account.

Step 2: Refer to notes from the client on how he wants his emails to be classified.

Step 3: Classify emails in one of three ways below, depending on client’s preference:

1. Using labels - go to the left side of your inbox and click “More”. You’ll see the option “Create new label”. In the pop-up window, name your label.

Object

Open the message you want to label. Click the label button (see image below). Check off each label you want to add, or create a new label.

Object

1. Color coding - you can color code emails without using labels. See here for a short instructional video on how to do that.
2. Adding color coding to labels - once labels are created, you also have the option of adding color codes to it. See here on how to do that.

Step 4:

After labeling emails, don’t forget to mark as “unread” those which the client hasn’t had a chance to read yet.

Archiving Email Messages

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email.
2. The client should identify what types of emails he would want archived immediately. Examples could include out-of-office notices, updates to calendar invites, etc.

Step 1: Using your delegated access, go to the “inbox” of your client’s email account.

Step 2: Refer to notes from the client on which types of emails he would prefer to archive immediately.

Step 3: Archive emails by opening a particular email or checking that particular email from the inbox, then clicking on the archive icon found on the menu bar on top.

Object

Note: Archiving is different from deleting. Never delete an email, unless there are explicit instructions from the client to do so. If that is the case, also list down the types of emails that client wants deleted immediately.

Unsubscribing from Emails

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email.
2. The client should identify what types of emails or emailing lists he wants to unsubscribe from.

Step 1: Open the email you would want to unsubscribe from.

Step 2: Click the “Unsubscribe” button, which you should be able to find at the top of your Gmail message.

Object

Then click the blue “Unsubscribe” button in the middle of your screen when prompted.

Object

You should then see this message at the top of your inbox:

Object

Step 3: In case you don’t see the “Unsubscribe” button, follow steps below to block the sender or mark the message as spam.

1. Open the email you want to block.
2. On the upper right corner, click More (three dots), or the arrow down in classic Gmail (Drop-down).
3. Click “Block [sender]”.
4. If you blocked someone by mistake, you can unblock them using the same steps.

Creating Email Response Based on Templates

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email.
2. The client should give email templates or stock responses as a reply to certain types of emails.

Step 1: Using your delegated access, go to the inbox of your client’s Gmail account.

Step 2: Refer to collection of email templates from client.

Step 3: Depending on the type of email received, respond using the corresponding email template.

Step 4:

Do not send the email response. Closing the email after keying in your response will automatically save it as a draft. You may also create a separate folder on “Drafts for Review” and store it there. The client can send the email response after reviewing, unless he gives you explicit instructions to send it on his behalf.

Creating Email Response Based on Voice Dictation

Voice dictation is primarily used for email responses. However, this could also be useful in calendar management (scheduling meetings), meeting debriefs, and in assigning administrative tasks. Dictations save time on the part of the client and is much more convenient.

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email.
2. Client should download the voice dictation app from his device here. Recordings can then be sent via email.
  1. If client wants to be able to upload recordings to Dropbox or Google Drive, he can use the in-app purchases or extensions here.

Step 1: Using your delegated access, go to the inbox of your client’s Gmail account.

Step 2: Check email (or Dropbox or Google Drive, depending on the preference of client) for voice dictations from the client.

Step 3: Transcribe the voice dictation as a response to a certain email.

Step 4:

Do not send the email response. Closing the email after keying in your response will automatically save it as a draft. You may also create a separate folder on “Drafts for Review” and store it there. The client can send the email response after reviewing, unless he gives you explicit instructions to send it on his behalf.

Creating a Free-Form Email Response

A response may be drafted by the EA when he/she has context about the email and feels confident enough to create replies to those. In any case, client should be consulted prior to drafting replies through this method.

What needs to be done first on the client’s side:

1. The client should give delegation access to his email.
2. The client should identify the types of emails which you can create free-form responses to.

Step 1: Using your delegated access, go to the inbox of your client’s Gmail account.

Step 2: Open the email which you feel confident you can create a free-form response to.

Step 3: Type in your free-form email response.

Step 4: Do not send the email response. Closing the email after keying in your response will automatically save it as a draft. You may also create a separate folder on “Drafts for Review” and store it there. The client can send the email response after reviewing, unless he gives you explicit instructions to send it on his behalf.

Full Support

Sending emails on behalf of the client

Once you’ve been drafting emails for the client for a while you can eventually earn their confidence to send emails directly (without them reviewing the draft).

Delegated email access vs. full email access: You can send emails on behalf of your client via delegated access; however, it will show something like “sent by Marni on behalf of Jonathan.” To be able to get rid of this, you would need full email access. This would mean logging in using your client’s username and password. Understandably, it might take time for your client to delegate this, or else, this might be something s/he would not be comfortable doing. Do not push for getting full email access unless you see that your client is already comfortable in doing so.

Playbook practice

* Practice manipulating the inbox settings by replicating Kristine's demo.
* From the recent emails you received from the Proactive Delegation Playbook certification:
  * Pick 15 emails
  * Create labels/filters in your inbox by following the video. 
    * Label them as Urgent, Please Handle, FYI.
* The goal of the exercise is for you to practice changing the settings in the inbox.

💡 Note: Creating drafts and knowing which label to use on emails will happen when you and client discuss and calibrate on their preferences.


VC Fundraising Playbook

Context

A lack of capital is one of the most common reasons why most startups fail. Fundraising is an important requirement for getting your business off the ground by giving you the necessary monetary support to run an idea and convert it into a working concept. Funds are needed to run operations, hire key team members,  and to support marketing and promotional activities. There are several ways to raise funds. Founders can crowdfund, raise money through angel investors, use their own personal assets (”bootstrapping”), or they can also raise through VCs or venture-capitalists. 

Each funding source has its pros and cons. One advantage of VC fundraising is that it gives your startup social proof and businesses credibility. If an institutional VC is backing a company, it goes without saying that they would have run their due diligence already. 

Just like startups though, VCs can vary substantially. Every fund has unique characteristics and finding a good fit can be the difference to huge growth or an ill-fated end for your startup. In order to ensure ..... good research, this playbook will show how you can generate a list of funding rounds relevant to your startup from Crunchbase. We then use Clay to further enrich your fundraising database with relevant investor data.

Strategy

* Align with EA on list of relevant company types you want to generate funding rounds from. 
* Set up Signal NFX and Crunchbase accounts and have EA generate your list.
* Create Clay account and have EA set up Clay tables with relevant integrations and formulas.
* 
* Review time spent weekly / monthly and adjust intentions—don’t worry about getting it perfect to start



---

Checklist

[ ] Draft V1 list of CB categories you want to generate a funding round on (i.e. ‘Healthcare’, ‘ClimateTech’, etc.)
  [ ] Filter by valuation or by amount raised ($500m in valuation, or $100m in amount raised)
  [ ] Filter by funding round (’Seed’, ‘Series A’, etc.)
  [ ] Filter by year (’2020 and onwards’, ‘past year only’, etc.)
[ ] Create & purchase Crunchbase Pro account (Tip: Crunchbase only allows annual plans upfront but if you sign up for a free trial and cancel stating that you cannot afford the annual pricing, they will offer you a monthly plan to keep your subscription. Use this to purchase a monthly subscription to set up your data)
[ ] Have EA set up the Clay table that pulls up the lead investor for each funding round, and the individual partner from the VC firm who led the deal. (guide below)
[ ] Have EA enrich list of partners, ideally getting their email or similar, then Twitter and LinkedIn (using Hunter or similar integration in Clay).
[ ] Have EA export the Clay table to Google Sheets / Airtable and review VC/funding round data.
[ ] Have EA cancel monthly Crunchbase Pro subscription once data is fully enriched. 
[ ] Have EA set a reminder to refresh Crunchbase data once or twice a year (or if you are really into connecting, just keep paying for it)

V2 Enhancements

* Additional data sources
  * Use the same general process on Signal NFX, which has different data from Crunchbase. Using the filters on the /investors page, scrape using DataMiner then enrich in Clay.



* CRM integration
  * Use Clay’s Airtable integration to automatically add/update investor data to your CRM.






Discovering Startups via Twitter Playbook



Context

* Twitter has emerged as one the ideal environments to follow leading founders, investors, and VCs to digest their thought leadership in real time, and to build your own presence by engaging with the VC Twitter community. Reading/following their activity allows you unfiltered access to their thoughts, opinions, and current investments.

Benefits

* Get a summarized digest of all the recent tweets, mentions, and URLs of notable founders, investors, and VCs.
* Immediately get enriched data for new startups and VCs that are automatically organized in an Airtable base for review.





EA Playbook Setup



* Create a copy of the Twitter Enrichment Airtable base. 
* Create a copy of the Rows Enrichment spreadsheet.

  A button labelled Import to Airtable found at the rightmost portion of each table has already been created for you. Once a cell has been fully enriched, you can just press the button and it automatically adds the data to your Airtable base.

  In order for the button to work, you’ll need to update the formula in the Airtable Import column with your Base ID and Table Name.

  image.png

  To get your Base ID, log in to your Airtable Rest API portal and select the base you want to access. Once done, proceed with the next steps:

  1. Go to Set-up > Tweet Groups and enter the Name, Twitter URL, and Twitter Username of the following people: Nikhil Krishnan, Tom Williams, Nikhil Basu Trivedi, Jeff Morris, Jr., and Bri Kimmel (We’ll want to update and add more people to watch for in the future but this is just a basic set-up). The formulas have already been set-up to automatically enrich the Tweets Group Airtable tab with their info.
  2. Go to the right, and click Import to Airtable button.
  3. Go to Set-up > Tweets, and click on the Import to Airtable button at the rightmost part of the table to import all tweets and mentions in the Tweets Airtable tab.
  4. Go to each page in the Mentions table and press the Enrich Mention button. Press Import to Airtable once table is enriched.
  5. Go to Tweeted URLs > URLs and press Overwrite to fill the table with all URLs that were tweeted. Press Import to Airtable once table is enriched.



* Review if any of the mentioned users are startups.
  1. Enrich mentioned startups using the Startups Enrichment table. 
  2. Press Import to Airtable to export to the Airtable base.


Weekly Client-EA Productivity Playbook



Why This is Important

1:1 meetings are a great tool for relationship building and information sharing. It’s also one of the best ways to provide and solicit feedback, and follow up on ongoing issues. For your first few weeks in Athena, you’ll use one-on-ones to continuously provide status updates on priorities, think through strategies, and lift blockers that the EA might have so they can be more empowered to provide you leverage.

Factor	Description
Cadence	Agree on a cadence that feels comfortable for both of you. Is it at the start or end of the week? You may also want to do bi-weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly, but try as much as possible to keep the schedule regular.
Duration	30 minutes is typical and respects both parties’ time.
Conversation	Small talk is good! Sharing personal details builds rapport but also provides important context. 

Ask about problems. Make the questions open-ended, but, if necessary, prompt with specific concerns you may have. Are there personal conflicts? Are projects on track? Are customers happy? Does the employee feel like they’re growing?

Provide and solicit feedback as part of an ongoing conversation. Look at your notes and focus on major recurring issues. Don’t bring a collection of small or “one-off” issues (they are better dealt with as they come up).
Follow up	Documentation makes one-on-ones concrete and encourages purposeful conversation.

Keep a running set of notes, and quickly update it after each meeting.

If you made any major decisions, or just need to acknowledge a significant concern, share a brief written re-statement (by email, Slack, etc.).




Setting the Agenda

Agenda items are split into different sub-pages (Tasks, Logged Hours, Objectives, and Key Results).

Feedback

If all is fine, that’s great! But please be candid and specific if you do have feedback. The magic of 1:1s happen when all participants regularly share their thoughts with each other on how valuable they find the current meetings and what could be improved. Nothing is set in stone, and feedback is your most powerful tool for making great 1:1s happen.

Some questions the EA can ask (and clients can prepare to answer are):

  * What did I do well?
  * What can I improve on?
  * How am I doing? Do you have any feedback for me?




WIP: Personal Network CRM Setup

Why This is Important

Better and more extensive connections means better access to investment opportunities, vital information, and - most important - high quality people with great ideas and fantastic potential. You can use this CRM to keep track of your relationships with people, as well as manage how you create and maintain contact with them.



Setting up

This Personal CRM Airtable is set up with all the info you need.

https://airtable.com/shrkMp7lQ29Jpl8GL



The CRM is split into four different tables:

​

* People
* Companies
* Geo
* Interactions

​

The ‘People’ table is the most important. Whenever I meet new people, my EA adds their names and contact info to this table. In addition to this, each record in the ‘People’ table contains the following fields that I fill in myself:

image.png

‘Active’ - do I consider my relationship with them to be currently active? Under ‘Cadence’ I record how often I should be chatting with this person. ‘VIP’ is a checkbox I use to tag the people I consider very important in my life. ‘Tag’ is a record of what network I was a part of when I get to know someone. Was it through college? Through work? Personal friendships? 

‘Delegation type’ tracks whether my EA can pre-draft emails for this person or if the contact is off-limits to him.

‘Preferred contact method’ records how I want to communicate with this person so my EA knows where to save his pre-drafts whether through email, WhatsApp, etc.

‘Interests’ is where I record what someone might be into. If someone is interested in medication adherence or behavioral economics, I’ll put that in here.

The other tables are filled in by my EA. ‘Companies’ records each person’s company info. ‘Geo’ shows where they are based. The ‘Interactions’ table is where I keep a record of when and how I interacted with each person. 



How the Airtable is put into action

When the EA does their Inbox Management at the start of the day, they can check the ‘Delegation Type’ view to see if they can respond as me, or if they’re not allowed to interact and can just notify me about the interaction. A third type ‘Pre-draft’ also lets them know if they can pre-draft responses to that person.

A formula using the column ‘Most recent interaction’ and two hidden columns called ‘Cadence in days’ and ‘Overdue days’ takes into account the last time I chatted with someone and how often I want to connect with them (Cadence). Anyone who has a “Overdue days” column value greater than 0 is someone who I am overdue to chat with. Airtable makes it easy to filter for values greater than 0, which I have moved into a new view called ‘Overdue Contacts’.

From there, you can create different views to filter the type of info you want to use at the moment. I’ve created views called ‘By Interest’ and ‘By Contact Method’ which I use when trying to reach out to an active or overdue contact.



Conclusion

At the end of the day, different people have have different views about what they want out of networking or what they need to track. At this point, you can create more tables to track things you want. Feel free to experiment and don’t be afraid to track more things.

How it works:

https://help.wfu.edu/support/solutions/articles/13000010313-google-2-step-verification-frequently-asked-questions-faq-





From Google’s support page:

Google Voice gives you a phone number for calls, texts, and voicemails. You can use this number to make domestic and international calls from your web browser and mobile devices. If you're in the US or Canada, you can choose your own number. Your organization can also assign you a Google Voice number.

In addition to using Google Voice for calls, texts, and voicemails, you can also:  

* Read voicemail transcripts in your inbox and search them like emails
* Call people in your contacts and organization
* Get protection from spam calls and messages
* Block unwanted callers
* Screen calls before you answer

Enrichment Process

How it works:



Rows allows you to instantly enrich an entire spreadsheet with data. Using it’s integration with Airtable, we can immediately pull data from various sources into Airtable, and use Zapier to generate a rich meeting bio email for your client to use.


Enriching data using Rows



Initial Setup

Visit rows.com/integrations and connect your Rows account to the following integrations:

1. Crunchbase 
2. Twitter 
3. BuiltWith
4. Airtable 
5. Create a copy of the Rows Enrichment HQ: Copy Rows

Enrichment Steps:

*  Start by navigating to the first page labelled ‘All Personas’, and go to the table labelled ‘Basic Info’. Manually enter the data for the cells labelled ‘Manual Input’ for each person you are creating a bio on.

Once all the ‘Manual Input’ cells are filled out, press the button labelled ‘Enrich Person’ to automatically fill out the fields to the right side of the table. You can also use the ‘Enrich All’ button if you are trying to enrich data for a large number of people.

*  Go to the second table labelled ‘Twitter’ and hit the ‘Enrich Twitter’ button to enrich user twitter data like the example below:



image.png

Do the same for the ‘Tweets’ and ‘Company’ table.

Take note the Company table has two enrichment buttons. You’ll need to manually input the 'Company Twitter 

Username’ before pressing the ‘Enrich Twitter’ button on the Company table to generate their twitter bio.

* Data for the ‘Education’ table needs to be input manually. The ‘Source’ column is automatically filled with the person’s LinkedIn Profile for you to find the information needed.



image.png

* Use the other Enrichment pages depending on the type of ‘Persona’ you are creating a bio for. The pages are labeled accordingly whether they are an ‘Investor’, ‘Founder’, or ‘Customer’.

Once you’ve finished enriching your spreadsheet, it’s now time to start importing the data to your Airtable base.

Importing to Airtable via Rows

A button labelled ‘Import to Airtable’ found at the rightmost portion of each table has already been created for you. Once a cell has been fully enriched, you can just press the button and it automatically adds the data to your Airtable base.

image.png

In order for the button to work, you’ll need to update the formula in the ‘Airtable Import’ column with your Base ID and Table Name.

image.png

To get your Base ID, log in to your Airtable Rest API portal and select the base you want to access.





⚠️ IMPORTANT: The export feature in the Airtable integration only works when there are no blank cells in the row. If there is any blank field, make sure to fill out the remaining information manually. If the field has to be left blank because there is no data available for that particular column, you’ll have to manually copy and paste the enriched fields to your Airtable base.

               image.png       image.png

6. Repeat step 5 for the ‘My Email’ column and add your client’s email.

Zapier

6. Connect your Gmail account by signing in.

7. Your action set-up should look like this:

To: “My Email”

From Name: Meeting Bios

Subject: Meeting Bio: “Full Name” | “Company Name”

Body: “Email Text”

     image.png  image.png

8. Make sure your Zap works by clicking ‘Test & Review’. A sample meeting bio using the fake data will be sent to your client’s email.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully set up your Airtable + Zapier automation. Now every time you tick the ‘Send Meeting Bio’ checkbox cell in the ‘All Fields’ view, Airtable automatically generates and sends a meeting bio to your client based on the data for that specific row.

Now that your base & automation has been set up, it’s time to learn how to start enriching data using Rows.



Let's get started!

                             
Tasks

Agenda items here are synced to the CY HQ tasks doc via Cross-docs. The Lookup function also allows you to group the tasks by OKR.

The great thing about synced docs is you can easily add annotations. I’ve added a ‘Comments’ column here which doesn’t get added to the original document so the comments we leave here are specific to the meeting. The client/EA can leave comments ahead of time or during the meeting.

OpenAI

Context

To reduce the workload on EAs and unlock greater productivity via more complex levels of automation and AI-enhanced human-in-the-loop workflows, we are experimenting with OpenAI. 

Usage

* It’s important to be very thoughtful with the prompt and try different things, including: 
  * telling it about a person’s background in several sentences before asking them to generate a message to/by them, 
  * being very specific about how technical/academic a generated paragraph should be (or who the audience is, e.g. summarize this for a high-school student), or 
  * giving it several examples and asking it to continue a list (e.g. of push notifications reminding someone to do something)

Notes

* We can use the playground instead of the API to do a lot of useful things related to code to use in Clay, Airtable, etc:
  * OpenAI can write javascript if you just ask it what you are trying to do
    * “Write a javascript function that filters the “X” array where key (”key”) is (“value”), and then return the value for key (“otherkey”)
    * “Use list comprehension to convert this into one line of JavaScript: “(some very long javascript we find online that needs to be one line for use in Clay)”
* We can use the AI to draft outlines for content, as long as the topic is not too obscure:
  * “Write an outline for an essay on the COM-B model of behavior change.”
  * Generating marketing copy things like Facebook ads based on a description of a given product, especially if we can figure out how to upload scraped data to “train” it
* We can use the AI as a step in other workflows, as an intelligent logic step to trigger actions in Zapier, Airtable, etc
  * Asking it if a paragraph references topic X, or if a description of an organization suggests it’s a venture capital firm
  * Writing a summary of a longer form of text (e.g. a podcast transcript, “Summarize the major points of this conversation”)
  * Extracting names, places, companies, etc from long text (e.g. find the scientists referenced in this lecture transcript)
  * Create a summary of data metrics (e.g. write an email summarizing the performance of this ad campaign, or how this EA spent their time last week) as a paragraph above

Ideas

* We can test a workflow where we feed the AI the last 10-40 messages in a conversation, and ask it to generate the next response
* We can test using the AI to summarize a meeting based on a call recording transcript, or maybe extract action items

Name	URL	Setup	Notes
Zapier zap with OpenAI that drafts an email	https://zapier.com/app/editor/153408257/nodes/153409803	* Emails with a certain star or label get modified with Zapier steps for text edits and javascript, and then sent to OpenAI with the prompt “reply to this email”
  * The first text action finds the horizontal line indicating that below that are previous emails in the thread, and only gets the text up to that line (to limit how much data is sent to OpenAI)
  * The first javascript action gets the person’s first name (Gmail only provides full name) and converts the email body to JSON (the format required for APIs
  * The second javascript step creates the body of the API call for OpenAI, which includes the fields to modify for getting ‘safer’ responses (e.g. temperature), and other options, and formats it as a JSON string
  * The ‘custom request’ step is the API call; it does a simple POST request to OpenAI
  * The text step after the API call removes extra spaces
* The Gmail step creates a draft based on the OpenAI response
  * Limitations: Zapier doesn’t allow you to add the draft to the same thread as a reply; it gets put in the drafts folder unattached to any email	* This is a great template for doing API calls in Zapier in general
Airtable base with OpenAI scripting app (Meeting Bios)	https://airtable.com/appyIF2hJ412mnBFk/tbl6h8tStP0eS6LW7/viweberkvlASKMAga?blocks=bipbWAyk9hS1v7tLz	* The scripting app in Dashboard 1 of this zap does an API call to OpenAI and generates a sentence about each person (row) with the same prompt
* In the future, we want to modify the prompt based on spreadsheet columns. 
  * For example, if the most recent fundraising round was <60 days, use a prompt based on that; e.g. ”Congratulate {FirstName} on {Company}’s recent fundraise”.
* The options to modify the API calls are in the line with “let PROMPT =”
  * Currently line 47
* The output is added to a column called OpenAI2 (there was an OpenAI column used with another Airtable app, which is no longer used)	* This is a great template for doing API calls in Airtable in general for the whole base; for one-per-row, the top half of the code is useful as a starting point. 
Clay base with OpenAI API calls	https://app.clay.run/workspaces/2318/tables/t_8gz0uLx3g7YW/views/gv_2PepLNTKDM6s	* The prompt column creates a prompt for OpenAI based on the person’s email and name.
* The data column prepares the API call and  sets the options for OpenAI and converts it to JSON
* The API call columns both call the OpenAI API with content from the other columns, and the “negative” one simply tells the API to provide a negative response (e.g. declining a meeting)	* This base has a manually-entered email, though obviously it could receive emails from a webhook in the future.
* We can customize what the prompt is based on other spreadsheet data, to make the responses more different and personalized. 
* This is a good template for API calls in Clay.

Otter Note on Playbooks

Gifting



Purpose

So the purpose of gifting is to eliminate any time or worry spent on finding gifts with people, and sending it to them. It's ultimately a way to systemize thoughtfulness and free ones to do other things. 

Setup

The Playbook should start with the people with the client discloses, so that might be their partner, their best friends, their children, their parents, nephews, or anyone who they regularly buy birthday gifts. We can extend that to anniversary gifts. Mother's and Father's Day, and special holidays like Christmas, Hanukkah and so on.

The first task is for the client to list the names of the people that they regularly buy gifts for. And ideally, also the string of their address, so that you can find it. If those addresses are saved in Amazon. The EA can clearly take care of that. The rest of this playbook requires that the that the EA has access to email. This will not work. If they don't.

So the next thing is, we should have some Google Search snippets that are generated by the air table so that the EA can search for historical gifts.

Prior to that, it would be ideal. If the client could name, some interests that the person has puts in their approximate age and approximate dollar range for the gifts to be appropriate, and lists what holidays. They get gifts on.

Next the EA will go in and they will build a record of historical gifts, and a page of gift events, which they can update once a year. And approximately one month before the gifts are required to be received. They should send a set of options to the differ. And then the client or gift there will select amongst the gifts that they should choose. The client may also wish to designate a consultant for a person. So for example, if they want to buy their mother or father in law, a gift. Those can be sent to the spouse or partner of the client. Either instead, or CC.

The way this playbook should work, by the way, is the client should make a copy and delete unnecessary sections and edit the others to cover their use case.

Weekly EA Meeting

So let's move on to the next playbook, which is running a weekly EA meeting. 

Purpose

So, like any meeting. The most important thing is that there is a good agenda and what I recommend for a weekly meeting is to first review the quarters priorities for both personal and business goals, and assess the progress toward those, then try to name some things which can be delegated for those. Next, we should review complex tasks that are in progress. Next, we should review tasks that need more detailed feedback and debugging, especially recurring pass, you should always be reviewed periodically. Following that, we should work down a list of trigger questions and trigger questions might include, what have I been putting off and haven't yet gotten started. Where am I not making progress quickly enough. And how can I help.

What goals or priorities would benefit from bringing in an expert, that the EAA can help to identify and spot check different areas in personal and business, and look for delegations in those areas, so this might include personal finance. On the business side, it might include or QA, so on and so forth. Also, prior to these most likely is the second or third item in this list of items should be the review of brain dump, items, or voice noted agenda items as collected during the previous week.

Another trigger question might be, what Playbooks. have I not yet turned on, that I would benefit from, And certainly the more of those we have, the more useful, an exercise that might be another trigger question is, Where am I spending too much time. And how can I minimize the time and attention on those tasks.

Optionally, you may also want to review certain data, like, hours of utilization of the EA, on health or growth of new accounts for the business, so on and so forth. 

And actually one more is what processes in EA interaction can be improved so am I not using enough voice notes. Should I be delegating directly to their task manager, Like Asana. Should I switch from email to Slack or so on.

And I believe that includes the weekly EA cadence. 

Personal CRM

Okay, next, CRM. CRM is a complicated one. But the best way to do it is to consider two separate groups. So, groups of people that I want to stay in touch with, or reactivate within the existing network. And then group to expand the network, and these should probably be two separate playbooks. So for now, let's focus on the existing network. There are a few methods to do this. And I believe that Dex is probably a good one, where we can do that. And we can do Cloud HQ for introductions or sent emails, depending on start populating there have the EA do some work for me. And then ultimately a client is going to have to prioritize. So, there should be some steps in there, we should have some instructions for the EA to label people. I think it's premature to set up the play configuration, but we can certainly consider it. And following that, there should be instructions on how to manage it on a weekly basis. And this could optionally be integrated as an agenda item into the weekly EA call.

Time Management

The next is, is time management. So, for the time management playbook. I believe that one way to do it is to set a top down, monthly or quarterly set of goals on how much time you spend on various things. So, how much time do you spend working out how much time do you spend reading or listening to podcasts, how much time do you spend in meetings, how much time do you spend with blocked creative time or focused work. How much time do you spend expanding your network, how much time do you spend reconnecting with people, how much time do you spend on one on ones. The content of these is not super important, but what is it, is we set an approximate set of benchmarks for these, we can always be changed, and the EA should set up a separate calendar for each of these time goals, and they should use them to monitor the approximate time spent in some cases, we may wish to create duplicate calendar events. 

So for example, if you have a meeting with your direct report. As the CEO. And that is a one on one, for example, with your CMO, and we want to track one on one time, or want to track internal versus external meetings or whatever the case may be. We should obviously create a calendar event for that on your business, calendar, but we should also create a duplicate events on your meeting time calendar or your one on one calendar or your internal meetings calendar or whatever the case may be. Right. And then we can easily set up a air table or another source to add the time in these different buckets and create reports that are effortless.

Then, during the weekly meetings, we can potentially review. What commitments in terms of existing meetings on the calendar are fixed and should be kept, so you may keep a standing all hands meeting, of course. And then which other ones should be moved to consolidate meetings. For example, if you choose to have at least one day a week of no meetings or at least one afternoon, we can enforce that here. And also, we can make sure to optimize for these different priorities by checking the amount of time. For the coming weeks, scheduling, what we need to schedule, for example the gym time and make sure that the other commitments, squeeze in around these larger priorities, and it works very similarly to the, the metaphor of, you have to put in the big rocks first, and the little rocks, fill around it, when filling up a bottle with rocks and sand, and so on. Okay. So that is quite a few. 

Personal Finance

We can also look at personal finance. The playbook for personal finance is probably to review major data points, like how much return, am I getting and how much money do I have in different places Where could or should it be moved to and integrating accounts into Fintable to produce reports on utilization and flows.

Venture Deals

Another playbook for venture, would be to log the various venture events, many of which probably live in PDS inside of the inbox or can be accessed through places that are in the inbox like Carta and Angel List and so on, and logging those so that we can calculate trends, calculate IRR, calculate other things, using a spreadsheet, similar to what we have with Jonathan, we can obtain logos, so on and so forth. I believe that's it for now, and we'll conclude here.

Email Management

TK
External Playbooks

We should review these and add the relevant/best ones to the playbook roadmap table, so we can create our own Athena version.
