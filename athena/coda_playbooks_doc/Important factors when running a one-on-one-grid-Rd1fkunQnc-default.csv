Factor,Description
Cadence,"Agree on a cadence that feels comfortable for both of you. Is it at the start or end of the week? You may also want to do bi-weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly, but try as much as possible to keep the schedule regular."
Duration,30 minutes is typical and respects both parties’ time.
Conversation,"Small talk is good! Sharing personal details builds rapport but also provides important context. 

Ask about problems. Make the questions open-ended, but, if necessary, prompt with specific concerns you may have. Are there personal conflicts? Are projects on track? Are customers happy? Does the employee feel like they’re growing?

Provide and solicit feedback as part of an ongoing conversation. Look at your notes and focus on major recurring issues. Don’t bring a collection of small or “one-off” issues (they are better dealt with as they come up)."
Follow up,"Documentation makes one-on-ones concrete and encourages purposeful conversation.

Keep a running set of notes, and quickly update it after each meeting.

If you made any major decisions, or just need to acknowledge a significant concern, share a brief written re-statement (by email, Slack, etc.)."
