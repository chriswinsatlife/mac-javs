# Positioning & ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

Athena positions itself as a premium executive assistant service helping top-tier leaders reclaim time and focus on high-impact work. Its messaging speaks directly to **busy executives, founders, and enterprise leaders** who are “doing it all” at the expense of strategic growth ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)). The core promise is **“time abundance”** – freeing founders/execs from administrative overload so they can *“do the work that moves you forward”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Get%20a%20dedicated%20executive%20assistant,stand%20the%20test%20of%20time)). Athena explicitly frames its EAs as *“Executive Partners”* integral to a client’s success rather than basic assistants ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Traditional%20assistants%20focus%20on%20a,your%20personal%20and%20professional%20worlds)) ([gm.linkedin.com](https://gm.linkedin.com/company/athenago#:~:text=,through%20the%20art%20of%20delegation)). This **strategic-partner positioning** appeals to CEOs, VCs, and entrepreneurs who value a higher-level support extending across both professional and personal domains.

Key elements of Athena’s positioning include:

- **Human & AI Augmentation**: Athena’s vision is a *“human + machine”* assistant that blends top human talent with AI tools ([www.valorep.com](https://www.valorep.com/athena-company-profile#:~:text=Opportunity%3A%20Delivering%20human,AI%20and%20broader%20technology%20tools)). This tech-enabled angle is part of the brand’s differentiation for executives seeking cutting-edge productivity. Athena promises *“AI-powered support”* combined with *“strategic human judgment”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=AI%20meets%20EQ)) to multiply a leader’s capacity.

- **Full-Time, One-to-One Partnership**: Unlike gig VA services, Athena provides a *dedicated full-time EA* for each client, in the client’s time zone ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Executive%20Assistant)). They emphasize one-to-one pairing (no shared assistants) to ensure deep integration into the executive’s life ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Does%20my%20EA%20work%20with,any%20other%20clients)). The ICP is expected to have enough responsibility (and budget) to leverage a 40+ hour/week assistant.

- **“Life Operating System”**: The service is positioned not just for work tasks but *“across your personal and professional worlds”*, suggesting the ICP could be anyone with a *“full life”* (executives, yes, but also busy parents or creatives) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=A%20Revolution%20in%20How%20We,Work%20and%20Live)). This broadens the target beyond just Fortune-500 CEOs to any high-achiever juggling intense schedules.

Athena’s messaging frequently underscores **the cost of not delegating** to resonate with its ICP’s pain points. For example, ad copy warns: *“Doing It All Is Costing You. What If You Didn’t Have To?”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)). By highlighting how much time a client could save (e.g. “200+ hours every month” in one VC’s case study), Athena appeals to hard-charging professionals who measure value in hours gained ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Executive%20Assistant%3A%20Is%20It%20the,Job%20for%20You%3FJune%2026%2C%202025Resources)). In summary, Athena’s positioning targets leaders who view time as their scarcest resource and are willing to invest in a **premium, tech-enabled service** to “unlock” more of it.

# Brand & Trust Signals

Athena cultivates a high-trust, authority brand – crucial given clients are delegating sensitive tasks. Several signals establish credibility and reduce purchase risk:

- **Top 0.5% Talent & Rigorous Vetting**: Athena markets its hiring funnel as more exclusive than Harvard. It receives ~1,000 EA applications daily and accepts only ~0.5% ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=We%20receive%20nearly%201000%20applications,calendar%2C%20travel%2C%20and%20inbox%20management)), meaning **“top-tier talent”** only. The site proudly notes Athena EAs come from the *“top 0.5% of 300k+ global applicants each year”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Expect%20more%20from%20an%20Executive,Assistant)). By emphasizing an acceptance rate *“<1%”*, Athena assures clients they’re getting the very best. This is reinforced with details: every EA undergoes background checks, personality/cognitive tests, and an *“immersive training on real-world tasks”* before ever being assigned ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=We%20receive%20nearly%201000%20applications,calendar%2C%20travel%2C%20and%20inbox%20management)). The intensive **Athena Bootcamp** is even touted as *“an acceptance rate more exclusive than Harvard University”* ([jobs.athena.com](https://jobs.athena.com/news/5-ways-executive-assistants-are-supported-at-athena#:~:text=Athena%20Careers%20The%20Path%20to,received%20a%20task%20unfamiliar%20to)). For clients, these stats serve as powerful proof of quality.

- **Extensive Training & Ongoing Management**: Athena doesn’t just vet EAs – it continuously trains and manages them. Each assistant is *“rigorously trained”* in Athena’s systems and has a dedicated Athena manager overseeing their performance and development ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=EA%20management%20and%20upskilling)). This *“EA performance management”* and upskilling is highlighted in the offering ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=A%20world,equipped%2C%20and%20employed%20by%20Athena)). It signals to clients that the assistants will keep improving and adhere to high standards (and that if issues arise, Athena proactively addresses them). Essentially, the client gets a *fully managed service*, not just a freelancer – a key trust point for enterprise buyers.

- **Security & Reliability Features**: Athena addresses common trust concerns of executives. They promise *“enterprise-grade security”* with measures like in-person vetting, NDAs/global legal accountability, cybersecurity protocols and *“advanced device monitoring”* on assistant devices ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=with%20the%20sound%2C%20strategic%20human,judgement%20of%20your%20EA)). By making security a selling point, Athena reassures clients their data and business info will be safe. Similarly, Athena EAs are W-2 employees of Athena (not contractors), which means the company handles payroll, benefits, and compliance ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=results%20in%20shorter%20tenures,benefits%2C%20compliance%2C%20and%20data%20security)). This reduces legal risk for clients and increases reliability (e.g. Athena can more easily replace an EA on leave). As one FAQ response puts it, *“we handle payroll, benefits, compliance, and data security”* so clients can delegate with confidence ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=results%20in%20shorter%20tenures,benefits%2C%20compliance%2C%20and%20data%20security)).

- **Testimonials & Social Proof**: Athena’s site features glowing **testimonials from executives** to build trust. For example, one client reports *“within 90 days [my EA] bought me back 20 hours per week… I now focus on bigger projects to move the business forward.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%E2%80%9C)) Another says their Athena EA of 3+ years *“anticipates my needs… has become one of the most critical members of my team”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%E2%80%9C)). Particularly striking is a testimonial from the founder of Levels: *“I started with one Athena EA and it was so impactful that I’ve now hired 20 Athena EAs for my company. Levels’ growth has been directly fueled by Athena.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20started%20with%20one%20Athena,been%20directly%20fueled%20by%20Athena)). Having a tech CEO publicly credit Athena with his startup’s growth is a huge authority signal. Athena smartly includes the company name (Levels) to enhance credibility for readers. 

- **Notable Endorsements**: Athena leverages the *word-of-mouth of respected founders and VCs*. On its “Why Clients Love Athena” page, it showcases real **tweets** from influencers. For instance, Sam Corcos (CEO of Levels) tweeted, *“If you’re looking for an agency to work with, I recommend @athenago. They’re great.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=For%20those%20of%20you%20looking,at%20Levels%20%F0%9F%8E%89)). Jesse Genet (entrepreneur) added that Athena *“is quietly powering many of the most powerful people I know.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=Jesse%20Genet)). Even Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover is featured voicing support (signaling startup world approval). By embedding these third-party endorsements, Athena taps into the trust those names command. It signals “industry leaders trust us, so you can too.”

- **Guarantees & Flexibility**: While not explicitly branded as a “guarantee,” Athena’s pricing model itself is a trust signal. Clients can start on a **month-to-month plan** (no long-term lock-in) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=Pay%20monthly)). It’s *“billed monthly, cancel anytime”*, which lowers the perceived risk for new customers. This flexibility acts as an implied guarantee of satisfaction – if the service isn’t delivering value, the client can walk away. Additionally, Athena offers to rematch or provide extra help if needs aren’t met: e.g. if a client ever needs more support, their *“Partnership Manager will take it from there”* to supply additional resources ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=What%20happens%20if%20I%20need,support%20as%20an%20Athena%20client)). These policies (easy exit, responsive support) make new clients feel safe giving Athena a try.

By combining elite credentials (top 0.5% assistants, Valor Equity-backed), strong testimonials, and concrete assurances (security measures, no long-term contracts), Athena builds a brand of **quality and trustworthiness** in the executive talent market. An executive visiting Athena’s site encounters many signals that “this is a **world-class, trusted service** for high-caliber leaders,” which is exactly the brand image Athena aims for.

# Website Conversion Strategy

Athena’s website is carefully crafted to **convert interested executives into sales consultations**. It uses clear messaging, intuitive flows, and upfront info to qualify leads. Key elements of their conversion strategy:

- **Strong Hero Messaging & CTAs**: The homepage immediately conveys Athena’s value proposition and pushes action. The hero section headline reads *“World-class assistants”* with subtext about dedicating an EA to handle your day-to-day while *“you do the work that moves you forward.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=World)) This concise statement hooks the ICP (busy leaders) by promising them relief and focus. Right below is a prominent **“Get Started” CTA** ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Get%20started)). Throughout the site, CTAs like “Get Started” or “Book a Call” are frequent and high-visibility. For example, after describing the service on the pricing page, Athena invites the visitor to *“Schedule a call to see how an Athena can power your success.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=Hire%20an%20elite%20executive%20assistant)). The **primary conversion goal** is clearly to get prospects on a call or intake form, where sales can then close them. The site funnels every page toward that step with repeated CTA buttons.

- **Transparent Pricing & Offer Details**: Unlike many enterprise services, Athena is very upfront about pricing on the site. The Pricing page lays out the cost: *“$3,000 per month, annual commitment ($36,000/yr)”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=%24)). It even shows a toggle for monthly vs. annual, noting ~8% savings if paid upfront ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=Better%20savings)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=EA%20performance%20management)). By publishing the **price and terms (annual commitment or month-to-month)**, Athena pre-qualifies leads – only executives who can budget ~$36k/year will pursue the conversation. The pricing section also lists exactly what’s included at that rate (e.g. *“vetted, trained, device-equipped EA employed by Athena; algorithmic matching; AI delegation tools; EA performance management”*) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=A%20world,equipped%2C%20and%20employed%20by%20Athena)). This feature list justifies the cost and functions as conversion copy, reinforcing value before the user hits “Get Started”. Pricing transparency builds trust and **reduces friction** – prospects know what to expect, which can shorten the sales cycle.

- **Persuasive Copy & Pain-Point Targeting**: Athena’s site copy doesn’t shy from reminding execs why they need help. One section headline bluntly states: *“Doing It All Is Costing You. What If You Didn’t Have To?”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)), immediately followed by the call to *“hire a full-time dedicated assistant and receive world-class delegation coaching.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)). This is conversion copywriting at work – it agitates the pain (the cost of trying to do everything) and presents Athena as the solution, **all in the CTA section**. Further down, the site has almost a mini “sales letter” describing the problem: *“We’re juggling deadlines, overflowing inboxes, and endless errands—leaving our visions for success, growth, and genuine connection behind. ‘Quick fixes’ aren’t cutting it. So why does delegating… still feel out of reach?”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20juggling%20deadlines%2C%20overflowing%20inboxes%2C,home%E2%80%94still%20feel%20out%20of%20reach)). By explicitly articulating the frustrations of the ICP, Athena creates urgency and emotional resonance, priming the visitor to click “Get Started” for relief. The **solution section** then immediately reassures them: *“Athena is the all-in-one platform designed to simplify delegation… With AI-powered support and expert assistance, we help you multiply your capacity and free up space for what truly matters.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Athena%20is%20the%20all,space%20for%20what%20truly%20matters)). The site effectively builds a narrative: you’re overwhelmed → imagine being free → here’s how Athena helps → act now.

- **Qualification via “Get Started” Flow**: When an interested prospect clicks “Get Started,” they are likely taken through a **qualification funnel**. Athena uses a subdomain (getstarted.athena.com) for this, indicating a multi-step form or scheduling tool. While the backend isn’t visible, typically such flows ask for information like name, role, company, and delegation needs, and then offer a booking calendar. Indeed, the call-to-action phrasing “Book a call” suggests the final step is scheduling a consultation with Athena’s team ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=Schedule%20a%20call%20to%20see,Athena%20can%20power%20your%20success)). By gathering a few key details first, Athena’s sales reps can come prepared to the call (and weed out completely unqualified leads). This **consultative sales approach** (see more in Sales-Led Motion) is built into the site UX – the site’s job is to convert interest to a scheduled call, not an immediate purchase. The site even offers a secondary CTA “Find Your Level” in some sections ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=A%20world%20where%20delegation%20isn%E2%80%99t,of%20a%20balanced%2C%20fulfilling%20life)), likely an interactive quiz or self-assessment on delegation skill. This is a smart lead-gen tactic: engaging prospects with a quiz/tool both educates them on Athena’s value and captures their contact info, all in a non-threatening way.

- **Social Proof & Objection Handling**: To assist conversion, Athena’s site interweaves trust elements (as noted above) in the conversion path. Scrolling the homepage reveals testimonials and statistics (e.g. top 0.5% of applicants) to **handle objections** about quality ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Expect%20more%20from%20an%20Executive,Assistant)). The FAQ page is easily accessible to address common questions like “Why not hire on my own?” – which it answers by emphasizing Athena’s low risk and high support (*“hiring your own EA is high-risk, time-consuming… Athena does the work for you… handles payroll, benefits…”*) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Why%20should%20I%20hire%20an,an%20EA%20on%20my%20own)). By preempting such concerns on the site, Athena smooths the path to conversion – prospects can self-educate and feel confident booking a call. 

In summary, Athena’s web conversion strategy focuses on **clarity, credibility, and a guided journey** to a sales call. The site balances giving enough information to persuade (clear value prop, pricing, examples) with strong calls to action that propel qualified leads into the funnel. For a global-talent marketplace, this approach of transparent value messaging + frictionless CTA + trust-building content can be highly effective in converting high-intent visitors.

# Content Marketing

Athena invests heavily in **content marketing** to educate its audience and establish thought leadership in delegation and productivity. Their content strategy spans blog articles, resource guides, and even a branded interview series – all tailored to demonstrate the impact of great executive assistants (and subtly, why Athena is the expert in this space).

Key components of Athena’s content marketing:

- **“Insights” Blog with Delegation Thought Leadership**: Athena maintains a robust blog (often under “Resources” or “Delegations” sections) with articles addressing both the *philosophy* and *tactics* of delegation. Many posts are educational, targeting keywords and common questions executives have. Examples of Athena’s thought leadership content include: *“How to Delegate to an Executive Assistant for Maximum Productivity”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Reclaim%20Your%20Time%3A%20The%20Power,Your%20Personal%20LifeOctober%2013%2C%202025Resources)), *“5 Virtual Executive Assistant Myths Debunked”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Athena%20Virtual%20Assistants%20vs%20Traditional,AssistantsJune%2027%2C%202025Resources)), and *“Why Chief Operating Officers Should Hire Executive Assistants”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Why%20Chief%20Operating%20Officers%20Should,Hire%20Executive%20AssistantsMarch%207%2C%202025Resources)). These pieces position Athena as an authority on effective delegation, offering value even to those who aren’t (yet) customers. Athena’s CEO Jonathan Swanson himself contributes content – for instance, writing about advanced delegation frameworks (*“Delegation Matrix”*) and mindset on their site ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/author/jonathan-swanson#:~:text=,Get%20Started)). By sharing their internal expertise publicly, Athena builds credibility and SEO presence.

- **Case Studies and Success Stories**: The blog also features many **use-case stories** that resonate with target audiences. They often highlight how specific executives or companies achieved results with an EA. For example, one article titles *“How a VC Partner Saves 200+ Hours Every Month with an Executive Assistant”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Executive%20Assistant%3A%20Is%20It%20the,Job%20for%20You%3FJune%2026%2C%202025Resources)) – an instant attractor for venture capitalists and founders. Another, *“40% Fewer Meetings: [How a] Healthcare CEO Has More Time Thanks to an Executive Assistant”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=40,an%20Executive%20AssistantJune%2027%2C%202025Resources)), speaks to corporate leaders in high-pressure roles. There’s even a piece on a CEO who built a **“CEO Office”** by onboarding a **team of EAs** ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=Executive%20AssistantJune%2027%2C%202025Delegations)). These stories serve as **mini case studies**, complete with quantitative results (hours saved, meetings reduced) and narrative, to help prospects envision Athena’s impact in their own context. It’s a classic content marketing move: show, don’t just tell. By reading such stories, a skeptical executive might think, “If a VC partner can reclaim 200 hours monthly, maybe I can too.”

- **“Art of Delegation” Interview Series**: Athena runs a signature content series called **“Art of Delegation,”** which features interviews with high-achieving leaders across industries and how they delegate. This is segmented by vertical – e.g. Healthcare, Legal, Retail, Tech – to attract executives in those domains ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/art-of-delegation#:~:text=All)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/art-of-delegation#:~:text=Finance)). In these pieces, notable figures share delegation tips and philosophies. For instance, Athena interviewed Dr. Eric Topol (a well-known digital medicine pioneer) to discuss how he uses delegation as a *“flywheel”* for greater impact ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/art-of-delegation#:~:text=Dr)). By associating Athena with luminaries like Dr. Topol, they elevate their brand and provide valuable insights to readers. It’s simultaneously **thought leadership content and subtle social proof** (i.e., “look, even top doctors leverage delegation”). This series likely appeals to enterprise prospects in those sectors and drives engagement through storytelling. It’s content that can be repurposed in many ways – blog articles, LinkedIn posts, maybe even webinars (if the interviews are video/audio).

- **Practical Delegation Guides & Playbooks**: In addition to high-level pieces, Athena produces very tactical content that executives or their assistants can use. Examples from their resource library: *“How To Delegate an Event Planning Checklist With an Executive Assistant”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=How%20Executives%20Can%20Leverage%20Change,Management%20ModelsAugust%2022%2C%202025Resources)) or *“How to Use Asana with Your Executive Assistant for Enhanced Productivity”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=Executive%20Assistants%3A%20The%20Hidden%20Superpower,Preventing%20Change%20FatigueAugust%2015%2C%202025Resources)). These “how-to” articles and checklists help executives envision daily working processes with an EA. Athena even shares internal methodologies, like *“The Athena Playbook in Action: Your Guide to Delegating Tasks”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/categories/delegations#:~:text=AssistantSeptember%2019%2C%202025Delegations%20How%20To,TasksJune%2027%2C%202025Delegations%20Delegation%20Framework)). Offering such actionable content for free not only boosts SEO (capturing long-tail searches like “delegating event planning to assistant”) but also nurtures leads. A startup founder who downloads a delegation checklist might realize how much they *could* offload – and remember Athena as the delegation experts who showed them the way.

- **Resources for EA Users and EAs Themselves**: Athena’s content also addresses the broader community around its service. There are pieces aimed at potential assistants or those curious about the EA career (e.g. “Executive Assistant: Is It the Right Job for You?”) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Why%20Chief%20Operating%20Officers%20Should,Hire%20Executive%20AssistantsMarch%207%2C%202025Resources)), which indirectly highlight Athena’s prestige (it reads almost like a recruitment ad but also signals to clients that Athena attracts serious talent). They also publish lifestyle and productivity content – e.g. “Athena Members’ Favorite Hotel Stays of 2025” or gift-giving guides ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=Get%20Started)). While lighter, this content reinforces that Athena understands the personal needs of execs (travel, gifting, etc.), again underscoring the *“whole-life support”* concept. 

Athena’s content marketing thus operates on multiple levels: **SEO-driven education, persuasive case studies, and thought leadership**. This attracts inbound traffic (someone Googling “hire executive assistant in Chicago” might find Athena’s city-specific guide ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/executive-assistant/chicago#:~:text=All%20signs%20point%20to%20one,Village%20are%20already%20spoken%20for))), nurtures leads over time (via newsletters or retargeting of blog readers), and strengthens brand authority. For other global-talent marketplaces, Athena’s strategy exemplifies how publishing high-quality content tailored to both common pain points and aspirational outcomes can drive organic growth and position your brand as the go-to expert.

# SEO & Organic Acquisition

Athena appears to have a savvy **SEO strategy** to capture executives actively searching for help or information. They create content targeting the keywords, questions, and even locations that potential clients might use. Some notable SEO tactics Athena employs:

- **Targeted Long-Tail Content**: Many of Athena’s blog titles read like the exact queries an executive would type into Google. For example, *“How to Hire a Top Executive Assistant in Chicago”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/executive-assistant/chicago#:~:text=How%20To%20Hire%20a%20Top,Whether%20you%E2%80%99re)) is clearly optimized for someone searching for an EA in that city. Indeed, Athena has developed **city-specific landing pages** (e.g. `/executive-assistant/chicago`) to rank for local searches. On the Chicago page, they include local business stats (600k business owners in Chicago, high demand in fintech, etc.) and then pivot to Athena’s solution ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/executive-assistant/chicago#:~:text=U,sectors%20like%20fintech%20and%20manufacturing)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/executive-assistant/chicago#:~:text=Fortunately%2C%20that%E2%80%99s%20where%20Athena%20steps,in)). This not only signals relevance to search engines (through location keywords) but also speaks to the reader’s environment (“competition for top assistants in the Chicago Loop is fierce… fortunately, that’s where Athena steps in” ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/executive-assistant/chicago#:~:text=All%20signs%20point%20to%20one,Village%20are%20already%20spoken%20for))). It’s a smart strategy: even though Athena’s EAs are remote, they address location-specific pain points (time zone, local talent scarcity) to capture those leads.

- **Broad Content Hubs Around Delegation/EA Topics**: Athena has structured its blog into categories like “Delegations” and “Resources,” building **content clusters** around key themes. Topics such as *delegation techniques*, *productivity improvement*, *executive assistant tips*, etc., are covered from multiple angles. This likely helps Athena rank for a variety of organic queries. For instance, consider an HR director searching “executive assistant vs virtual assistant” or a founder searching “should I hire an executive assistant startup” – Athena has content that fits (like *“Athena Virtual Assistants vs Traditional Assistants”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Athena%20Virtual%20Assistants%20vs%20Traditional,AssistantsJune%2027%2C%202025Resources)) and *“Why [COOs] Should Hire Executive Assistants”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/blog/posts/5-virtual-executive-assistant-myths-debunked#:~:text=Why%20Chief%20Operating%20Officers%20Should,Hire%20Executive%20AssistantsMarch%207%2C%202025Resources))). By covering not just Athena-specific news but the whole domain of using assistants effectively, they capture high-intent visitors who are still in the research phase. Once on the site, those readers can be converted through calls-to-action embedded in the content.

- **SEO Optimized Case Studies**: The case-style blog posts also serve SEO purposes with their descriptive titles. “40% Fewer Meetings: Healthcare CEO Has More Time…” or “VC Partner Saves 200+ Hours Every Month…” contain juicy keywords like “Executive Assistant” and “saves hours” that align with productivity searches. They likely attract clicks from people searching generically for ways to save time or delegate tasks. Additionally, by publishing *fresh content frequently* (the blog has many posts per month in 2025, per the dates ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=Conquer%20the%20Change%20Management%20Process,an%20Executive%20AssistantSeptember%2019%2C%202025Delegations)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/insights/how-a-vc-partner-saves-200-hours-every-month-with-an-executive-assistant#:~:text=How%20Smart%20Leaders%20Impact%20Employee,Productivity%20August%208%2C%202025Resources))), Athena keeps its site active in the eyes of search algorithms. 

- **Backlink and PR-driven SEO**: Athena’s content efforts also feed their organic acquisition via backlinks. When notable outlets or individuals mention Athena (e.g. Sam Corcos’s First Round Review article on delegation, or Jason Calacanis on his podcast), those often come with backlinks or at least brand mentions. The First Round Review piece written by a happy client, for instance, is a form of PR content that likely links to Athena or at least drives curious readers to search Athena ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=For%20those%20of%20you%20looking,at%20Levels%20%F0%9F%8E%89)). Similarly, the *This Week in Startups* episode featuring Athena’s founder would be accompanied by show notes online, including Athena’s URL ([thisweekinstartups.com](https://thisweekinstartups.com/episodes/RD9F5OqkiTe#:~:text=Delegating%20is%20its%20own%20unique,Plus%2C%20Jason%20and%20Jonathan%20look)). Such high-authority backlinks (from FRR, TWiStartups, etc.) likely boost Athena’s domain authority, helping all their pages rank higher. 

- **Technical SEO and Site Structure**: Athena’s site structure seems optimized for both UX and SEO with clear sections: a primary site for marketing pages and a blog that uses descriptive URLs (`/blog/posts/[title]` or category pages like `/executive-assistant/chicago`). Their content pages interlink logically (e.g., blog posts often link to related posts or the “Get Started” page). Also, the site’s copy naturally uses relevant keywords (executive assistant, delegate tasks, productivity, etc.) without sounding forced – likely improving relevance. Even the FAQ page is keyword-rich, directly addressing queries like *“How does Athena differ from a virtual assistant service?”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=How%20does%20working%20with%20Athena,or%20a%20traditional%20staffing%20company)) which could match search queries about Athena vs others.

Overall, Athena’s **organic acquisition** playbook combines **informative content** (to capture search interest) and **strategic SEO optimization** (targeting locations and long-tail keywords). The takeaway for other global talent marketplaces: invest in creating content around the questions and needs your prospects search for, including localized or niche queries, and structure that content so it’s friendly to both readers and search engines. Athena shows that ranking for the right terms can bring a stream of high-quality inbound leads who are already primed to seek a solution.

# Paid Acquisition (Ads & Offers)

To accelerate growth beyond organic traffic, Athena leverages paid acquisition channels – using compelling ad creative and offers to draw in busy executives. 

**Search Advertising**: It’s likely Athena runs Google Ads targeting keywords like *“hire executive assistant”*, *“virtual executive assistant service”*, etc. Evidence of this comes from the fact that Google search results sometimes display Athena’s messaging in an ad-like format. One snippet (likely from a Google ad or special meta description) reads: *“Doing It All Is Costing You. What If You Didn’t Have To? Hire a full-time dedicated assistant and receive world-class delegation coaching.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)). This sounds precisely like ad copy: it identifies the pain (“doing it all”), poses a solution, and adds a **value prop sweetener** (“world-class delegation coaching” included – something unique Athena offers). By bidding on high-intent keywords and showing this persuasive copy, Athena can capture prospects right when they’re seeking help. The **offer in the ad** – an EA + delegation coaching – helps differentiate from generic VA services. Athena essentially advertises not just an assistant, but a *personal productivity upgrade*.

**Social Media Ads**: Athena also likely advertises on LinkedIn, given their B2B executive target. LinkedIn Ads can pinpoint by seniority, industry, or role (e.g. founders of Series A startups, or VPs at companies of X size). The **messaging on LinkedIn** often mirrors their thought leadership. For example, a post from Athena’s LinkedIn mentions: *“delegation is often misunderstood… the best leaders use it to scale faster, not do less”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_delegation-people-business-activity-7320162368896782337-sG9Z#:~:text=topic%20,The%20best)) – content that could easily be repurposed as a sponsored post to engage an exec audience. Athena might promote things like their case study articles or invite sign-ups for a webinar via LinkedIn ads, drawing people into their content funnel. Additionally, Athena’s use of **visual social proof** (like images of tweets from Sam Corcos or quotes from testimonials) could be leveraged in retargeting ads. An executive who visited Athena’s site might later see a LinkedIn ad with a quote “Athena bought me back 20 hours a week – CEO, [Company]” to reinforce credibility and prompt them to reconsider the service.

**Ad Creatives & Landing Pages**: The paid ads we have insight into are rich in emotional and outcome-driven language. Phrases like *“Work and Life Are Broken. Let’s Fix Them.”* appeared on Athena’s landing page experiment ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Work%20and%20Life%20Are%20Broken,Let%E2%80%99s%20Fix%20Them)) – likely an ad landing headline to resonate with overwhelmed professionals. The landing page copy continues to push the pain point (juggling deadlines, overflowing inboxes) and then introduces Athena as *“The Solution to Effective Delegation”*, an **all-in-one platform to offload tasks to the right people at the right time** ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20juggling%20deadlines%2C%20overflowing%20inboxes%2C,home%E2%80%94still%20feel%20out%20of%20reach)). This indicates Athena is customizing landing pages for campaigns, not just dumping ad traffic on the generic homepage. They probably A/B test these pages (the URL we saw had a query parameter suggesting an A/B test variant ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Hire%20a%20full,class%20delegation%20coaching))) to optimize conversion. 

**Retargeting and Offers**: For executives who show interest but don’t convert immediately, Athena likely runs retargeting ads (on Facebook, LinkedIn, maybe even display ads via Google). These could emphasize trust signals or limited-time offers. While Athena doesn’t advertise discounts publicly aside from annual plan savings, they do have a *referral program* that gives new clients a discount via referrals ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20receive%20a%20unique%20referral,reward%20and%20your%20referral%E2%80%99s%20discount)). It’s conceivable that in paid campaigns they mention *“Schedule a call and get your first week free”* or something similar as an incentive (though we have no direct evidence of a free trial, given the nature of the service). At minimum, the **month-to-month no commitment** is itself an offer they highlight in ads (“cancel anytime” flexibility), because it lowers barrier to entry ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/pricing#:~:text=Pay%20monthly)).

**Channels**: Outside of Google and LinkedIn, Athena might experiment with niche channels: sponsoring relevant newsletters (for instance, a productivity newsletter for CEOs), or Twitter ads targeting followers of productivity gurus. We saw their Twitter handle @athenago mentioned by influencers; they could amplify that by promoting tweets or using those quotes in Twitter ads targeting terms like “#startup” or “#executiveassistant”. Given the size of Athena’s team (4000+ employees suggests a substantial marketing budget from millions in ARR), it’s plausible they test many ad channels and double down on what works (likely LinkedIn and Google Search being prime).

In summary, Athena’s paid acquisition seems to focus on **hitting the pain point hard, offering a compelling solution, and making it easy to take the next step**. By including delegation coaching or similar value-adds in ad copy, they differentiate from competitors. Other talent marketplaces can learn from this: craft ads that **empathize with the customer’s burden and clearly articulate the transformative outcome**, and ensure the landing page continues that story with as little friction as possible to convert (Athena’s landing page flows straight into a “Get Started” call to action with minimal distraction). Combined with retargeting that reinforces trust (testimonials, credentials), this increases the chances that a busy exec will finally say “Okay, I need this” and click to inquire.

# Partnerships & Affiliates

Athena fuels its growth not only through direct marketing, but also via **partnership channels and referrals** that tap into existing networks of its target customers. Some notable partnership and distribution tactics:

- **Venture Capital & Accelerator Networks**: Being *later-stage backed by Valor Equity Partners*, Athena likely gains access to Valor’s portfolio and network of tech execs. VCs often introduce services like Athena as “value-add” to their founders. It wouldn’t be surprising if Athena has a presence in VC community forums or as a recommended partner for portfolio companies (e.g., Valor could negotiate a discount for all founders in their fund to try Athena, though not publicly confirmed). Additionally, Athena has connections to Y Combinator circles through its founder’s background (Jonathan Swanson co-founded Thumbtack, a YC alum). Posts on LinkedIn show Athena being discussed in startup mentorship contexts ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jillkoziol_referral-executive-assistant-athena-activity-7037257751856644096-sReR#:~:text=Referral%20,learned%20I%20could%20gain%20leverage)). **Executive assistant services are frequently recommended in founder groups**, so Athena likely works to be *the name* that VCs, accelerators (like YC, Techstars), and startup CEOs pass around when someone asks “How do you handle admin tasks?”. This kind of word-of-mouth partnership can be immensely powerful and much of it is seeded by having investors and early evangelists plugged into those circles.

- **Executive Communities & Events**: Athena targets executive communities such as YPO (Young Presidents’ Organization), EO (Entrepreneurs’ Organization), Vistage, etc. Their strategy might include sponsoring or speaking at events for these groups. For instance, Athena could host a workshop on “Delegation 10x” at a leadership conference or run private roundtables for CEOs (with an Athena rep and an existing client sharing how they use their EA). Such events position Athena as a thought leader and allow them to **demonstrate value in a community setting**. Even if not directly evidenced, Athena’s “Art of Delegation” series could be repurposed into live webinars or panel discussions for executive groups. We do see Athena content like “Delegation Quick Wins” being featured, possibly in member-only sessions ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_michael-houck-got-insights-from-jonathan-activity-7160950339976781824-PhfI#:~:text=Michael%20Houck%20got%20insights%20from,Explore)). Also, the founder’s appearances on podcasts (like This Week in Startups) effectively partner Athena with those media hosts, reaching their audience of entrepreneurs.

- **Referral Program (Affiliate-like)**: One of Athena’s strongest growth drivers is an **incentivized referral program** for existing clients. Every Athena client is automatically enrolled, with unique referral links and landing pages to share ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=match%20at%20L346%20You%E2%80%99ll%20receive,reward%20and%20your%20referral%E2%80%99s%20discount)). The incentives are notably rich: when someone joins via your referral, *the new client gets a discount on their membership, you (the referrer) get a cash reward, and even your EA receives a $500 bonus* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=What%20do%20I%20receive%20for,a%20successful%20referral)). This 3-way win is a clever structure – it motivates the client to refer (they get a thank-you payout), and it motivates the assistant to encourage their executive to refer friends (because the EA benefits too, which is unusual). Athena claims these are *“some of the strongest incentives in the industry”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Yes,your%20referrals%20and%20your%20EA)), and indeed it shows in behavior: multiple executives have posted on LinkedIn praising Athena and implicitly or explicitly referring others. For example, one user wrote about how hiring an Athena EA was a “game-changer” and likely included their referral link ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elissaliu_referral-executive-assistant-athena-activity-7042596502812168192-7fy9#:~:text=Elissa%20Liu%E2%80%99s%20Post%20Elissa%20Liu,care%20of%20recurring%20financial%20tasks)). By turning happy customers into brand ambassadors, Athena taps into trust-based marketing. Executives trust recommendations from peers far more than ads, so this channel likely brings high-converting leads. The referral discounts also lower friction for the new client (who might get, say, $500 off or similar).

- **Alliances with Service Providers & Coaches**: Athena might partner with adjacent service providers – e.g., productivity coaches, fractional COO agencies, or financial advisors who cater to execs – forming a referral exchange. If a leadership coach has a client overwhelmed by tasks, they could recommend Athena (and possibly get a referral fee). In reverse, Athena’s team might refer clients to partner services (like bookkeeping firms or travel concierges) to complete the support ecosystem, which encourages those partners to send clients back Athena’s way. While we haven’t seen specific names, this kind of B2B partnership is common (for example, an executive HR consultancy might bundle Athena as a solution in their recommendations). 

- **Influencer and Content Partnerships**: Athena leverages content partnerships such as the First Round Review article by Sam Corcos (an Athena client) where he detailed how EAs transformed his productivity ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=For%20those%20of%20you%20looking,at%20Levels%20%F0%9F%8E%89)). That piece acts as a high-credibility referral for Athena to all First Round’s readership (which is thousands of startup founders). Similarly, Athena’s team or clients appear on podcasts (Jason Calacanis touting Athena, Eric Jorgenson interviewing Jonathan Swanson ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_michael-houck-got-insights-from-jonathan-activity-7160950339976781824-PhfI#:~:text=post%20to%20learn%20more%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Flnkd,Explore%20content%20categories))) – these are essentially partnerships with content creators that drive brand awareness in target circles. Athena might also provide guest content or co-branded studies with productivity blogs or publications (e.g., “Athena x [Productivity SaaS] report on how execs spend time”). Each partnership extends Athena’s reach to new audiences in a trusted manner.

- **Affiliate Marketers**: It’s not a huge focus (given the niche audience), but there are “comparison” blogs and remote work websites that mention Athena vs competitors. Athena likely doesn’t rely on broad affiliate marketers, but it benefits from these third-party reviews. For instance, sites like PearlTalent and Wishup’s blog compare Athena with others ([www.pearltalent.com](https://www.pearltalent.com/resources/athena-executive-assistant-top-7-competitors#:~:text=Find%20your%20next%20hire)) ([workstaff360.com](https://workstaff360.com/the-best-executive-assistant-services-athena-vs-top-competitors/#:~:text=Athena%20positions%20itself%20as%20a,their%20assistants%20perform%20really%20well)). If Athena has an affiliate arrangement, those reviews might be influenced by commissions. However, Athena’s own referral program is more central, since its clients (who are well-connected execs) are more effective evangelists than generic affiliates.

In essence, Athena expands via **trusted networks** – whether through formal programs (referral incentives) or informal influence (VCs and happy clients spreading the word). For other global talent marketplaces, Athena’s approach shows the value of **embedding yourself in the ecosystems your clients belong to**. By partnering with their investors, peer groups, and service providers – and by arming existing customers with both the goodwill and rewards to refer others – you create multiple low-cost acquisition channels built on trust. Athena’s rapid growth (reportedly multi-million ARR and thousands of employees) is a testament to how effective these network effects can be when deliberately cultivated.

# Social Media & Distribution Strategy

Athena’s social and content distribution strategy focuses on **meeting executives where they already engage online**, particularly on professional networks like LinkedIn, as well as amplifying community buzz on Twitter. Rather than mass consumer social media, Athena tailors its approach to “executive-style” content on platforms frequented by business leaders.

- **LinkedIn Presence – Knowledge Sharing and Social Proof**: Athena maintains an active LinkedIn page with over 180k followers (as of recent counts) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_delegation-people-business-activity-7320162368896782337-sG9Z#:~:text=topic%20,The%20best)), indicating a strong content push there. They regularly post thought leadership snippets, delegation tips, client success stories, and company updates on LinkedIn. For example, a LinkedIn post by Athena teased a concept: *“Delegation is often misunderstood… The best leaders use it not to do less, but to accomplish far more.”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_delegation-people-business-activity-7320162368896782337-sG9Z#:~:text=topic%20,The%20best)). This kind of content is educational and inspirational, aimed at engaging execs scrolling LinkedIn with bite-sized insights. Athena also uses LinkedIn to **recycle and distribute their longer-form content** – e.g., summarizing a blog post or podcast and then linking to it. One can see posts referencing insights from Jonathan Swanson’s interviews (a post about “mastering the art of delegation to become a time billionaire” was shared, likely linking to an external article or Athena blog) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athenago_michael-houck-got-insights-from-jonathan-activity-7160950339976781824-PhfI#:~:text=Michael%20Houck%20got%20insights%20from,Explore%20content%20categories)). By consistently sharing valuable content (not just promos) on LinkedIn, Athena stays top-of-mind for its followers and attracts new ones via shares and LinkedIn’s content algorithms.

- **Showcasing Client Wins and Testimonials Socially**: Athena uses social media to **broadcast client success**, effectively turning their customers into micro-influencers. On Twitter, they benefit from clients organically shouting them out – as seen with Sam Corcos, Jesse Genet, Ryan Hoover tweeting endorsements ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=For%20those%20of%20you%20looking,at%20Levels%20%F0%9F%8E%89)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%40jessegenet)). Athena then amplifies these by showcasing them on their site and likely reposting on LinkedIn (“Retweeting” in a visual form for LinkedIn). This creates a virtuous cycle: prospects see respected names praising Athena on social feeds, which reinforces the brand’s authority. Athena’s own LinkedIn page can share these quotes, e.g., *“‘Athena is quietly powering many of the most powerful people I know’ – @jessegenet”*, alongside a call-to-action for readers to learn more. Such posts serve as social proof to Athena’s entire follower base.

- **Thought Leadership by Founders/Execs**: Athena’s CEO and leadership also contribute on social platforms. Jonathan Swanson, for instance, reposted content like an essay about his productive morning thanks to delegation (mentioning how his Athena assistants got his podcast published, emails sent, invoices paid – all before 10am) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathanwswanson_ea-va-executiveassistant-activity-7106244722741956608-2LBB#:~:text=Jonathan%20Swanson%20posted%20on%20LinkedIn,2%20important%20invoices%20got%20paid)). This kind of personal testimonial from the founder resonates on social media, blending authenticity with promotion. It signals that Athena’s team *uses their own medicine* (they have multiple EAs themselves) and firmly believes in the delegation lifestyle. Founders of other marketplaces can emulate this by being vocal on social about how they solve the problems their product addresses – it humanizes the brand and spreads the message organically.

- **Community Building & Engagement**: While Athena’s client base is busy execs (not typically hanging out in Facebook groups), Athena still fosters a sense of community through social initiatives. They might, for example, host live Q&As on LinkedIn or short “Art of Delegation” video snippets featuring guest experts. Additionally, Athena likely uses platforms like **Twitter not for broad marketing but for key influencer engagement**. Their handle @athenago is mentioned in contexts that suggest they monitor and engage with relevant conversations (like when entrepreneurs discuss needing assistants). By promptly responding or offering insight in such threads, Athena can capture interest in an authentic way. 

- **Distributing Content via Email**: Though not explicitly social media, a piece of Athena’s distribution is likely an email newsletter or drip campaign. Executives who download a resource or fill the Get Started form but aren’t ready to commit likely get nurturing emails – which include recent blog posts, delegation tips, maybe upcoming webinars. This keeps Athena’s content in front of leads. In essence, Athena repurposes their prolific content into multiple channels: blog → LinkedIn → email → and sometimes Medium or other sites via contributors, ensuring maximum reach.

- **Employer Branding on Social**: With 4,000+ employees (mostly EAs), Athena also has a social media presence for recruiting. The company posts on LinkedIn about its culture and growth, which indirectly supports marketing – happy employees often share these, extending Athena’s visibility. Also, many Athena EAs themselves are on LinkedIn and likely speak about working for Athena, which prospective clients might see. An example is *Athena Executive Services* (a related entity or perhaps an old brand) sharing tips on LinkedIn about EA value for certain industries ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/athena-executive-services_ep-53-how-executive-assistants-drive-growth-activity-7369070851075268613-0R3n#:~:text=So%2C%20previously%20we%20broke%20down,specific%20VAs%20and%20what%20they)) – even if not the same company, it increases overall Athena keyword presence on social.

**Takeaway**: Athena’s social strategy is about **credibility and education** rather than viral stunts. By consistently sharing high-value content and leveraging the voices of their satisfied clients and team, they build an online presence that feels *helpful and trusted*. This aligns well with their high-end brand. For global talent marketplaces, Athena illustrates the power of using LinkedIn for thought leadership distribution, encouraging user-generated praise on platforms like Twitter, and turning that into marketing material. It’s a subtle, reputation-driven approach that suits a product targeted at discerning professionals.

# PR & Earned Media

Athena has garnered **earned media attention** and deliberately pursued PR opportunities that cement its reputation as a leader in the executive support arena. Rather than broad consumer press, Athena’s PR focuses on outlets and formats that influence executives, investors, and the startup community.

- **Tech and Startup Press**: Athena hasn’t (to public knowledge) blasted out big funding announcements on TechCrunch, but they’ve smartly leveraged *strategic press*. For instance, First Round Review – a publication by First Round Capital, widely read by founders – featured an in-depth piece by Sam Corcos (CEO of Levels) detailing how he uses Athena’s assistants ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=For%20those%20of%20you%20looking,at%20Levels%20%F0%9F%8E%89)). This kind of earned media is gold: it reads as a peer case study rather than an ad. The article not only educates on delegation but also name-drops Athena as the enabling service. It essentially turned a happy client into a *media advocate*, reaching tens of thousands of target readers (startup CEOs). The credibility of FRR and the authentic voice of a founder make it extremely persuasive.

- **Podcasts & Speaking**: Athena’s leadership, especially CEO Jonathan Swanson, has appeared on popular podcasts. A standout example is **Jason Calacanis’s “This Week in Startups”**. Jason is a well-known angel investor and executive himself – he not only interviewed Jonathan, but outright endorsed Athena as *“one of my favorite startups”* and shared that **he personally uses 2 Athena EAs** ([thisweekinstartups.com](https://thisweekinstartups.com/episodes/RD9F5OqkiTe#:~:text=Delegating%20is%20its%20own%20unique,But%20getting%20the%20MOST%20out)). In that December 2025 episode, Jonathan discussed “Black Diamond Delegating” (advanced techniques) and how he manages 6 assistants himself ([thisweekinstartups.com](https://thisweekinstartups.com/episodes/RD9F5OqkiTe#:~:text=one%20of%20his%20favorite%20startups%2C,Plus%2C%20Jason%20and%20Jonathan%20look)). This exposure on TWiST is significant PR: it signals to the tech community that Athena is a vetted solution by someone like Jason, and it provided nearly an hour of deep content to explain the service’s value. Similarly, Jonathan was interviewed by Eric Jorgenson (author of “Leverage/Work” newsletters) in an episode titled *“Designing an Ideal Life, Founding Thumbtack, 10x Delegation”* ([www.ejorgenson.com](https://www.ejorgenson.com/podcast/jonathan-swanson#:~:text=Designing%20An%20Ideal%20Life%2C%20Founding,%E2%80%8BJonathan)). Such podcast appearances allow Athena to tell its story in a narrative, engaging way – covering not just the service, but the mission of changing how people work and live (which is compelling PR messaging).

- **Press Releases & Awards**: While we didn’t see typical press releases, Athena likely touts key milestones quietly. For example, Valor Equity Partners listing Athena on their site is a form of validation ([www.valorep.com](https://www.valorep.com/athena-company-profile#:~:text=QUICK%20FACTS)). Athena might have applied for and won awards like “Best Workplace for Innovators” or local business awards in markets they operate (e.g., if they have a Philippines base, possibly awards there). Any awards or accolades would be used in marketing collateral. Even statements like *“<1% acceptance rate, more exclusive than Harvard”* ([jobs.athena.com](https://jobs.athena.com/news/5-ways-executive-assistants-are-supported-at-athena#:~:text=Athena%20Careers%20The%20Path%20to,received%20a%20task%20unfamiliar%20to)), though not an award, are the kind of bragging-right stats that get media mention. A niche site, *Alts.co*, actually wrote a review of Athena in early 2024, intrigued by the model of “outsourced assistants in the Philippines for busy execs” ([alts.co](https://alts.co/where-did-all-our-assistants-go-a-review-of-athena/#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20looking%20at%20a,with%20busy%20executives%20and%20entrepreneurs)). That kind of independent review (even if slightly sensationally titled “Where did all our assistants go?”) is earned media that spreads awareness to investor types reading Alts.

- **Conferences and Panels**: Athena may not target consumer tech conferences, but likely participates in industry-specific events. For instance, an Athena representative might speak at a CEO summit about “The Future of Work: Human + AI assistants” or at a productivity conference like TED-style talk. Even if not a headline speaker, they might appear on panels about remote work or AI in admin support. These appearances often lead to media coverage or at least recorded content that Athena can share. Additionally, Athena could host its own virtual summits (webinars with high-profile guests like in their Art of Delegation series). If done well, those can attract press or at least significant social media chatter that functions like PR.

- **Podcasts by Clients or Partners**: Another earned media angle: clients of Athena talking about it on their own media. Example: when Sam Corcos goes on other podcasts or writes, he often mentions his approach to time management – which includes using Athena. Or if a VC partner client speaks on an industry panel, they might casually remark “my EA (from Athena) sorted this out…” which is subtle PR by proxy. Athena benefits from these second-hand mentions. In one LinkedIn post, an entrepreneur Jill Koziol recounted *“a trusted friend told me I was doing it all wrong… by hiring an Athena EA I learned I could gain leverage”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jillkoziol_referral-executive-assistant-athena-activity-7037257751856644096-sReR#:~:text=Referral%20,learned%20I%20could%20gain%20leverage)). That kind of personal story, even on LinkedIn, often gets picked up or at least amplifies the brand image publicly.

- **Media Handling of Potential Critiques**: It’s worth noting Athena’s model (outsourcing to developing countries at a markup) could attract critique in media around labor practices. The *alts.co* piece and competitor blogs hint at “Athena pays assistants minimal compensation” ([workstaff360.com](https://workstaff360.com/the-best-executive-assistant-services-athena-vs-top-competitors/#:~:text=Athena%20positions%20itself%20as%20a,their%20assistants%20perform%20really%20well)). Athena’s PR strategy likely involves being transparent about their training investment and career development for EAs to counter any “virtual sweatshop” narratives. The fact that they emphasize providing EAs with good careers, benefits, and growth (even on the Valor page) ([www.valorep.com](https://www.valorep.com/athena-company-profile#:~:text=,house%20AI%20apps)) is part of framing the story positively. So far, Athena has maintained a positive image, focusing PR on how they help executives and create well-paying remote jobs, rather than getting mired in controversy – a testament to good communication strategy.

In summary, Athena’s earned media approach is about being **part of the conversation in future-of-work and startup circles**. By getting influential voices to talk about them and by sharing genuine success narratives, they’ve earned credibility that no ad budget can buy. Other marketplaces can observe how Athena chose their PR targets wisely: it’s less about blasting a press release to everyone, and more about *deep integration into thought leadership channels* that their target customers pay attention to.

# Community & Events

Athena’s service inherently creates a community of **“Athena Members”** – busy leaders all practicing the “art of delegation” – and the company leverages this through community-building and events that engage and educate both clients and prospects. While much of Athena’s operation is one-to-one (one EA paired per client), they add value by fostering a broader sense of community and shared learning around delegation.

- **Exclusive Client Community**: Upon joining Athena, clients are treated as part of an elite membership. Wording on the site like *“Join Athena Members and start saving 650+ hours a year”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/author/jonathan-swanson#:~:text=,Get%20Started)) suggests that Athena markets the idea of a *member community*. This could manifest as invitation-only events for clients: for example, monthly virtual roundtables where Athena clients swap delegation tips, moderated by Athena’s team. It’s easy to imagine an “Athena Members Summit” (virtual) where top-performing EAs and some of those high-profile clients (like the CEO of Levels or others) share how they maximize the partnership. Such events not only provide extra value to clients (learning new ways to use their EA) but also strengthen their bond with Athena (increasing retention). It effectively creates a **community of practice** around being a great delegator.

- **Webinars & Workshops for Executives**: Athena likely hosts public-facing webinars that double as lead generation. Topics might include *“Time Management for CEOs: Delegation Strategies that Work”* or *“From 60-Hour Weeks to Time Abundance: How to Delegate Effectively.”* These sessions could feature Athena’s delegation coaches or even client guest speakers. By advertising these webinars on LinkedIn or via email lists, Athena can attract execs who are interested in improving productivity. The webinar content demonstrates Athena’s expertise (and often features how an EA can be instrumental), subtly pitching the service. At the end of such workshops, attendees are often given a CTA like “If you want personalized delegation help, schedule a call with Athena.” This is a classic funnel: provide free educational events to engage potential customers and then convert a percentage to clients.

- **In-Person Executive Events**: Given Athena’s clientele are global, many interactions are virtual. However, for key markets (say, San Francisco or New York), Athena could sponsor small in-person gatherings. Imagine a private dinner or happy hour for founders/CXOs on the topic of scaling businesses by scaling your support team – hosted by Athena. They might bring a notable speaker (maybe Jason Calacanis or another advocate) to talk about leverage and assistants. These intimate events help Athena build relationships with prospects in a high-touch way. If one Athena client brings a friend (prospective client) along, it becomes a warm introduction scenario thanks to community vibe.

- **Community Content (User Contributions)**: Athena’s *Art of Delegation* series itself has community overtones – featuring stories of various leaders. They might invite members to contribute blog posts or be interviewed (which many would love, as it gives them exposure too). Additionally, Athena could run competitions or challenges – e.g., a “Delegation Challenge” where members try to delegate one new thing every day for a month and share results. This kind of initiative, possibly done in a forum or private Slack group, engenders a camaraderie among Athena users (“we’re all improving together”). The social proof of seeing peers succeed encourages broader and continued use of Athena’s services.

- **Training Programs & Certification**: On the EA side, Athena definitely has an internal training academy (bootcamp for assistants). They might occasionally open up parts of that training as events for clients or the public. For instance, a webinar on “Athena’s Delegation Matrix 101” could be attended by both clients and curious non-clients, giving a peek into Athena’s methodology. Also, by **certifying** their EAs in various skills and possibly sharing that with clients (for example, “Athena EAs undergo 100+ hours in our Academy; here’s a client webinar with our Head of Training on how we develop EAs”), they instill confidence and involve clients in the process. 

- **Sponsoring Relevant Conferences**: Athena might not host big conferences itself (beyond user gatherings), but it could sponsor and have a presence at conferences that executives attend – for example, SaaStr Annual (for SaaS founders), or industry-specific CEO summits. Having a booth or a speaking slot at these events is both marketing and community building – it puts Athena in the conversation when execs are discussing operational challenges.

For global talent marketplaces, Athena’s approach highlights the importance of building a **value-adding community around your service**. It’s not just “here’s a transaction, thanks bye”; Athena invests in making clients better delegators through collective learning (which in turn makes the service more valuable). By creating forums for users to share experiences and learn (be it an online group, regular webinars, or an annual meetup), you increase customer engagement and turn clients into evangelists. Athena’s growth has a lot to do with this *club effect* – being an Athena client feels like joining a forward-thinking group of leaders who have “cracked the code” on productivity, and that’s a powerful draw.

# Sales-Led Motion

Despite being productized, Athena employs a **sales-led motion** appropriate for its high-ticket, B2B-like service. This means dedicated sales representatives guide potential clients from initial interest to signed membership, with a consultative approach tailored to busy execs.

- **Inbound Lead Qualification**: Most of Athena’s leads come through inbound channels (website, referrals, content). Once an executive clicks “Get Started” and submits their info or schedules a call, Athena’s **sales team (Account Executives)** steps in. These reps likely qualify the lead on criteria like role, urgency of needs, and ability to afford $3k/month. The FAQ hints at initial sales conversations: *“we’ll set clear expectations during your initial sales calls so you know what to expect”* regarding timelines ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Once%20you%20sign%20your%20membership,you%20know%20what%20to%20expect)). This implies a salesperson spends time understanding the client’s needs and explaining the process on an introductory call. The tone is **consultative** – the rep is positioned more as a productivity consultant than a hard seller.

- **Discovery & Consultative Selling**: On the first call, an Athena sales rep will ask about the executive’s pain points: What tasks consume your day? Where do you need help? They essentially perform a “delegation audit” to identify areas Athena can add value. Then the salesperson would map Athena’s offering to those needs (e.g., if the client struggles with scheduling meetings, the rep explains how Athena EAs are trained in proactive calendar management; if the client needs help at home, they note personal tasks are included, etc.). This personalized assessment makes the exec feel understood and builds confidence that Athena isn’t a one-size-fits-all, but a *tailored solution*. Athena’s materials (and likely the sales scripts) emphasize that an Athena EA will *“integrate into the full scope of your life to transform the way you work and live.”* ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=provide%20security%2C%20training%20infrastructure%2C%20and,way%20you%20work%20and%20live)) This is selling a partnership, not a commodity.

- **Membership Agreement & Onboarding**: Once the prospect is convinced, the sales team secures a **membership agreement** (the contract). Athena calls its clients “members” likely to imply exclusivity and ongoing value. The sales motion doesn’t end at signing – it transitions into a robust onboarding led by an **Onboarding/Partnership Manager**. According to the FAQ, after signing, there’s an intake survey, a 90-minute onboarding call, and a Delegation Foundations training for the client ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Our%20onboarding%20process%20is%20designed,to%20officially%20launch%20your%20partnership)). Sales likely stays involved to ensure a smooth handoff to the onboarding team, because a lot of B2B churn can happen if a client feels lost early. Athena’s onboarding takes 2-3 weeks to match you with the right EA ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20typical%20lead,for%20working%20with%20an%20EA)), which the sales rep would have set expectations for. This relatively long lead time (for high-demand periods) is something sales has to manage transparently, to keep the exec patient by selling the value of careful matching.

- **Account Management & Upsell**: Post-onboarding, each client is supported by a *Partnership Manager* (think account manager) in addition to their EA ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=What%20happens%20if%20I%20need,support%20as%20an%20Athena%20client)). This person’s role is to check in with the client regularly, ensure the EA-client relationship is flourishing, and act as a troubleshooter. If the client’s needs grow or change, the partnership manager can recommend solutions – e.g., temporarily assign additional Athena “fractional” help if their EA is overloaded, or even **upsell** another EA if the client could use more hands. We saw a testimonial where a client went from 1 EA to 20 EAs for his company ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20started%20with%20one%20Athena,been%20directly%20fueled%20by%20Athena)) – such scale-ups indicate an enterprise sales motion where Athena might negotiate volume pricing or dedicated team arrangements. The sales team likely has an enterprise arm to handle companies wanting 5, 10, 50 assistants deployed. Even though the standard price is $36k/EA/year, enterprise deals could be in the hundreds of thousands with some customization (and thus involve higher-level sales execs and maybe even the founders in closing those deals).

- **Handling Objections & Comparisons**: Athena’s sales reps are armed with plenty of ammo to address common objections. If a prospect says “Why not just hire a local EA myself?”, the rep can cite the FAQ talking points: hiring yourself is *“high-risk, time-consuming, costly, shorter tenures”*, whereas Athena starts with top 1% candidates and handles all HR overhead ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Why%20should%20I%20hire%20an,an%20EA%20on%20my%20own)). If a client is concerned about an offshore EA’s accent or skills, the rep can highlight Athena’s rigorous English testing and training program ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=We%20receive%20nearly%201000%20applications,calendar%2C%20travel%2C%20and%20inbox%20management)), and even that EAs are full-time in your time zone ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=Executive%20Assistant)). For security concerns, they point to Athena’s enterprise-grade measures. Essentially, Athena’s **value proposition is reinforced at every stage of the sale**: quality, consistency, and breadth of support (personal + professional tasks) that you can’t get from a typical VA or a quick hire.

- **Sales Cycle & Closing**: Given the price and target, the sales cycle is relatively short – an individual executive can decide in a matter of weeks. It might take 1–3 calls: initial discovery, a follow-up perhaps to meet a candidate EA or further discuss scope, and then closing. They may even involve a bit of a *“try before you buy”* — e.g., some services allow an introductory call with a potential assistant. Not sure if Athena does that, but if they do, it would be coordinated by sales towards the end of the cycle to seal the deal. Also, Athena likely leverages **social proof during sales** (reps share anecdotes: “By the way, 3 partners at [Top VC Firm] use Athena” or “We’ve helped founders from Y Combinator achieve X”). Knowing their clientele, a prospect feels reassured that “people like me” trust Athena.

- **Enterprise Motion**: For larger organizations, Athena’s sales approach adapts. They might pitch to a CEO and also to the HR/Operations lead who could champion an initiative like “20 EAs for our top 20 execs.” In those cases, Athena would highlight things like **scalability and consistency** – how they can roll out trained assistants quickly and manage them at scale. Security and legal compliance become bigger selling points too, which Athena is prepared for (global legal accountability, etc.) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=with%20the%20sound%2C%20strategic%20human,judgement%20of%20your%20EA)). The enterprise sale might involve custom SLAs or integration with the client’s systems (and likely a custom contract beyond the standard membership T&Cs). Athena’s ability to say *“we’ve done this for other companies, here’s how we manage a team of EAs for you”* becomes crucial. The fact that their service is essentially “EA-as-a-service” can be pitched as an **alternative to building out an internal admin staff** – a CFO might appreciate the cost predictability and not having to hire 20 individual assistants themselves.

In conclusion, Athena’s sales-led motion is about **high-touch guidance for a high-value service**. The sales team functions almost like productivity consultants, using Athena’s robust infrastructure as the solution to recommend. The model shows that even in a marketplace/managed-service business, a strong salesorganization can accelerate growth by handling client concerns personally and tailoring the offering. This approach can be translated to other global talent marketplaces where the spend is significant and the service is complex – having a human sales guide greatly improves conversion and client confidence for premium offerings.

# Unique Growth Tactics & Differentiators

Athena’s meteoric growth has been propelled by some **creative and unique tactics** that set it apart from typical outsourcing companies. These strategies not only attract customers but also reinforce Athena’s positioning as a premium, innovative player. Here are a few stand-out tactics and how they translate broadly:

- **“Delegation Coaching” as a Value-Add**: Athena doesn’t just sell an assistant’s labor; they sell *better delegation habits* for executives. Every Athena client goes through **Delegation training** during onboarding ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Our%20onboarding%20process%20is%20designed,to%20officially%20launch%20your%20partnership)) – essentially learning how to offload work effectively. They even market this as *“world-class delegation coaching”* included with the service ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Doing%20It%20All%20Is%20Costing,You)). This is a genius growth tactic: it addresses the common issue that first-time executive assistant users have – not knowing what or how to delegate – which if left unchecked could lead to dissatisfaction. By coaching clients, Athena ensures they fully utilize the EA (increasing the perceived value). It also differentiates Athena from other services (“others give you an assistant; we teach you to become a delegation pro”). For other marketplaces, the lesson is to **educate your customers to maximize product value** – e.g., a freelancing platform could provide consulting on how to work with freelancers successfully. Athena turning client education into a selling point (and even ad copy highlight) is relatively unique in this space.

- **Extremely Selective Recruiting (Talent is the Marketing)**: The fact Athena accepts <1% of EA applicants – and boldly compares that to Harvard’s selectivity ([jobs.athena.com](https://jobs.athena.com/news/5-ways-executive-assistants-are-supported-at-athena#:~:text=Athena%20Careers%20The%20Path%20to,received%20a%20task%20unfamiliar%20to)) – is itself a marketing weapon. It creates an aura of exclusivity and top-notch quality that justifies the price. Athena’s **“academy” for EAs** (a rigorous training + bootcamp) not only produces better assistants, but also serves as a story to tell in press and marketing. They’ve essentially productized their *training program* as part of the brand. Clients feel they’re getting an “Athena-certified” EA who has cleared a high bar. This tactic of heavily investing in talent screening/training pays off twofold: one, it improves delivery (happy customers who trust their assistants), and two, it gives marketing bragging rights that no pure marketplace of freelancers can claim. It’s similar to how TopTal grew by advertising “Top 3% of freelancers”. Athena took it to 0.5%. Any global talent marketplace can consider if there’s a way to **quantify and publicize their vetting** to stand out (e.g., “only 5% of applicants become [YourCompany] certified experts”).

- **Guaranteeing a One-to-One Dedicated Relationship**: In an era where many VA services assign teams or rotate assistants, Athena made the distinctive choice that each client gets *their* EA, and that EA works for no one else ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Does%20my%20EA%20work%20with,any%20other%20clients)). This “one EA per member” rule is a unique selling point – it fosters true partnership and long-term bonding. Athena doubles down by promising *long-term tenure* and career growth for EAs within Athena ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=Unlike%20virtual%20assistants%20and%20traditional,way%20you%20work%20and%20live)), which implies to clients that they won’t experience the churn and turnover common in admin roles. Some of Athena’s marketing emphasizes multi-year relationships (testimonials referencing 3+ years with the same EA) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/testimonials#:~:text=%E2%80%9C)). For growth, this increases referral likelihood (because over years, the client’s positive experience deepens) and lifetime value. It’s a tactic somewhat against the typical marketplace grain (where coverage and flexibility is emphasized over exclusivity), but it works for the executive segment who value trust and continuity. It’s a reminder that sometimes **doing what doesn’t scale – like one-to-one matching – can become a moat** if your competitors all force shared, less personal models.

- **Integration of AI Tools (Tech Halo Effect)**: Athena positions itself as *tech-forward*, integrating AI into the assistant workflow. Phrases like *“AI meets EQ”* and mention of proprietary AI apps ([www.valorep.com](https://www.valorep.com/athena-company-profile#:~:text=Opportunity%3A%20Delivering%20human,AI%20and%20broader%20technology%20tools)) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/#:~:text=AI%20meets%20EQ)) give Athena a modern edge. While the human EA is the core, Athena’s narrative of *“human-in-the-loop automation”* ([www.valorep.com](https://www.valorep.com/athena-company-profile#:~:text=Opportunity%3A%20Delivering%20human,AI%20and%20broader%20technology%20tools)) makes executives curious – it suggests Athena assistants are supercharged with technology (perhaps using GPT-4 for drafting emails, smart task automation, etc.). This likely appeals to tech-savvy clients and venture investors, creating a halo that Athena is not just another BPO but a *“future of work”* company. As a growth tactic, Athena can tap into the buzz around AI and get coverage or interest that more traditional competitors wouldn’t. It’s also a defensive moat: developing internal AI tools for their EAs (as they claim to do) improves efficiency, which could either boost margins or allow assistants to do more, benefiting clients. For other marketplaces, adopting and marketing new tech (AI, automation, analytics) in the workflow can differentiate you and attract early-adopter customers, even if the core offering is a service.

- **Strong Referral Incentives (including for workers)**: We discussed the referral program in Partnerships, but it’s worth highlighting as a unique growth lever. Athena not only pays clients for referrals, but also rewards the assistants serving those clients (with a $500 bonus per referral) ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/faqs#:~:text=When%20someone%20joins%20through%20your,will%20also%20receive%20a%20bonus)). This is unusual – it effectively enlists the entire company, both customers and employees, into the growth effort. An EA has a direct incentive to encourage their executive, “Hey, if you have any fellow CEOs who could use an EA, let me know – Athena has a great referral program.” It’s a gentle nudge from EA to client that could spur more word-of-mouth. Aligning incentives across all stakeholders (customer, company, worker) for growth creates a powerful flywheel – **everyone wins when a new client joins**. Other marketplaces might emulate this by giving service providers a bonus for bringing in new client business or vice versa.

- **Brand Language & Identity**: Athena has crafted a distinct brand voice around empowerment and even mythology (named after the Greek goddess of wisdom). Subtly, this comes through in terms like “Athena Executive Partners” (elevating the assistant’s title) and calling clients “members” not customers. They even call their staff and clients collectively the “Athena community” under “Athena’s Aegis” in one content segment ([www.athenaac.com](https://www.athenaac.com/blog#:~:text=Athena%20Advisory%20Collective%20%E2%80%94%20Under,priorities%20and%20design%20a%20strategy)) (an aegis is a protective shield associated with Athena – a clever nod). This consistent brand ethos makes Athena memorable and almost aspirational – using Athena feels like joining a visionary movement to change how work gets done. For growth, having this **mission-driven aura** can attract both customers and talent who align with the philosophy, not just the utility. It also opens doors to PR and partnerships because Athena isn’t framed as a utilitarian outsourcing firm but a company trying to “fix work and life” ([www.athena.com](https://www.athena.com/?ab041e94_page=2#:~:text=Work%20and%20Life%20Are%20Broken,Let%E2%80%99s%20Fix%20Them)). That grand narrative is a growth asset in itself.

In summary, Athena’s growth isn’t just from executing standard playbooks; it stems from **reframing the service in a novel way** (assistant + training + tech, not either/or) and aligning every part of the business to reinforce that. They’ve essentially productized something as old as an executive assistant into a modern, premium subscription with its own methodology and community. Other global talent marketplaces can draw inspiration from Athena’s approach to differentiation: combine excellence in your core service with creative layers of value (education, technology, community), and turn those into your talking points. When done well, these unique tactics not only attract clients but also create a category where your company is seen as the leader pushing boundaries. Athena’s trajectory – from startup to a scaled global team – shows how effective this kind of holistic, innovative strategy can be.
