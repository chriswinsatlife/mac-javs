Each venture represents not just a new product, but a fundamental shift in how we live and work.

HPA reacts too late, forcing teams to overprovision just to avoid slow scale-ups and service degradation. Meanwhile, observability tools ingest massive amounts of redundant data, driving up costs without improving reliability. You’re either wasting money or risking downtime; there’s no middle ground.

Thoras.ai fixes this.

Thoras is your AI for Kubernetes. It predicts workload demand before it happens, so your infrastructure scales exactly when needed with no excess, and no guesswork. Instead of reacting to spikes after they occur, Thoras analyzes historical patterns, real-time telemetry, and seasonality trends to forecast demand with precision. The result? Higher utilization, fewer wasted resources, and lower cloud bills, with zero sacrifice to performance.

At the same time, Thoras tackles observability bloat. Monitoring stacks collect thousands of low-value metrics, logs, and traces that provide little diagnostic value but significantly increase ingestion and storage costs. Thoras automates the identification and removal of redundant data, cutting observability costs while keeping the critical insights you need.

Thoras delivers predictive scaling, AI-driven observability cost reduction, and Kubernetes-native security without requiring API calls or sending data outside your cluster. It eliminates overprovisioning, stops wasted compute, and ensures reliability without excess.

Backed by top investors like Wellington Ventures, Sinewave Ventures, and Focal VC, Thoras is transforming how engineering teams scale Kubernetes.

Since then, the company has evolved to take on a more complex supply chain challenge that every brand faces: What should we do with slightly damaged returns, store try-ons, minor manufacturing defects?

Currently, the brands only have a few (not ideal) choices: costly recycling - difficult when the materials are not built to be recycled easily; donations - also difficult since donation centers cannot process that much volume; and as the last resort, incineration or destruction of the goods.

Hemster offers Revive as a first-in-line solution. Before recycling or donating, let our AI-powered platform make a decision of whether this small damage is worth cleaning or repairing to be sold. Only when the damage is too much, we will enter the responsible disposition channels.

We bring together financing, vetted equipment, standardized facility designs, our custom-built smart facility management software, and access to credit buyers—so operators can build a new line of income alongside their existing business.

Biochar is one of the most proven, scalable, and durable carbon removal methods available today. In 2025, it has already enabled over 100,000 tonnes of verified removals, more than any other method. By heating crop waste—like husks, shells, and prunings—at high temperatures without oxygen, biochar locks carbon away for centuries and creates credits that sell for far more than typical offsets.

Agribusinesses value biochar because it turns low-value waste into reliable revenue and improves soil health. Buyers value it because it’s verifiable, cost-effective, and available now. But despite the demand, supply still lags. High upfront costs, sourcing challenges, and complex carbon markets have slowed new producers from getting started.

Terraton exists to change that.

Currently, I serve as Chief of Staff and Venture Partner at SPLY Capital and SPLY Finance, where I lead firm-wide execution, portfolio operations, and cross-functional growth.

My path to venture was shaped by hands-on operating experience — starting at REI and quickly shifting into entrepreneurship. As Co-Founder and President of FLIKR Fire, I was thrown headfirst into building a company from the ground up. Over four years, I led the business through rapid growth, scaling to over $15M+ in lifetime sales, with $7.1M in peak annual revenue and an average 243% year-over-year growth rate— which ultimately led to a successful exit. That chapter shaped much of who I am as a builder and operator.

After FLIKR Fire, I stepped into consulting and fractional leadership roles across AI, hospitality, and consumer startups—helping founders scale ops, refine GTM, and raise capital. I also launched another venture of my own that didn’t take off, but shaped how I think about focus, timing, and execution.

Before stepping into SPLY Capital, I served as EVP and Chief of Staff at EKOM AI, where I led product direction, go-to-market strategy, and operational scale. The role spanned roadmap development, systems design, investor readiness, and cross-functional execution—translating vision into growth across the business.

I’m energized by bringing clarity to complexity, helping build great people, and supporting customers through focus, strategy, and action.

One of the most important leadership principles I hold is a “No Surprise Culture.” I believe in transparency, direct feedback, and making sure people always know where they stand. Feedback is a gift, and when teams operate with honesty and trust, performance accelerates.

I’m also a believer in moving quickly -- but deliberately. Analysis paralysis is the enemy of progress. We try things, learn fast, fix what needs fixing, and keep going. Urgency, iteration, and thoughtful risk-taking are essential to building momentum.

Jim Collins has been a key influencer in how I lead: get the right people on the bus and in the right seats—and continually ask whether those seats even belong on the bus. Prioritization is everything. Clear “what’s in / what’s out” alignment helps teams stay focused, and I subscribe to the idea that we all need not just a To Do list, but a To Don’t list as well.

I’m passionate about leveraging technology and AI to make us sharper, faster, and more efficient. I don’t believe AI will replace us—but I do believe that people who embrace it will outperform those who don’t. If we’re not moving forward, we’re moving backward.

Above all, leadership is about people. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing someone grow, gain confidence, and achieve their career goals. That’s the work that matters most to me.

Outside of work, I’m a proud dad of three and someone who values balance across family, community, friendships, and time to recharge.

Cammisa Markel is dedicated to making the U.S. immigration process as simple and painless as possible, and pride themselves in building long-term relationships with their clients.

Founder and principal attorney, Zjantelle Cammisa Markel, arrived to the United States in 2000 from her hometown of Adelaide, South Australia, with the intention of a brief visit. Two decades, a husband, four children and a giant bernedoodle later, New York has become her home, and enabling other people’s American aspirations to happen isn’t just her work, but her passion.

Offering a highly personalized service, Zjantelle is driven to achieve positive outcomes for all of her clients and believes that with a no-defeatist attitude, where there is a will, there is always a way. Professional and friendly, Zjantelle obtains working visas for people at all levels of their career and life – from students to corporate executives. Having been through the U.S. immigration process herself (she has previously held J-1, H-1B and E-2 visas prior to marrying her U.S. citizen husband in 2006, and becoming a green card holder in 2007 and a U.S. citizen in 2014), she has been committed to building a practice that not only provides exemplary legal services, but also a high level of personalized service that ensures every client feels secure and well taken care of throughout the often anxiety provoking immigration process.

Zjantelle’s career spans Sydney, London, Rome and New York. This international experience gives her a unique understanding of European, Australian and American culture, laws and business practices. Her Australian background and specialization in processing E-3 visas make Zjantelle particularly popular with Australian clientele. Several well-established Australian media and news organizations including the Australian Financial Review, have quoted Zjantelle and sought her opinions related to U.S. immigration law during times of uncertainty and international crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Zjantelle has been honored by her professional peers and colleagues as a “Super Lawyer” (top 5% in her field of law) for the New York Metro area every year since 2013 and has been recognized in Super Lawyers magazine and in the New York Times Magazine (March in each of those years) as one of the top female lawyers in New York City.",United States,"New York, New York, United States",Cammisa Markel PLLC,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cammisa-markel-pllc,Cammisa Markel PLLC,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/6611378_company_logo,442,"30 Vesey St, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10007, US","New York, New York",2003,US,81917895,cammisamarkel.com,Privately Held,cammisa-markel-pllc,"Cammisa Markel, PLLC is a U.S. immigration law firm based in New York.

Our immigration practice is dedicated to making the U.S. immigration process as simple and painless as possible, for both our international corporate and individual clients. We determine an immigration “Plan” for each client that looks beyond the client’s immediate U.S. immigration needs and considers the client’s individual long-term U.S. immigration goals and objectives. We are not afraid of holding our client’s hand from the beginning to the end of the U.S. immigration process because we understand that at times we need to be more than just an immigration law firm. Our immigration staff pride themselves on providing friendly, knowledgeable and accessible U.S. immigration services that are up-to-date with U.S. Immigration laws and are results oriented. Unlike other immigration law practices, our U.S. immigration lawyers and immigration law staff come from other countries like Australia, so they are familiar with the immigration process on both sides of the immigration wall.

In less than three years, I have bootstrapped the company to over $3M in annual recurring revenue, interviewed more than 750 CEOs, and helped over 250 leaders strengthen their presence, credibility, and reach on LinkedIn.

At Executive Presence, we turn leaders into thought leaders. Many executives have networks of people who know and trust them, but they are not consistently top-of-mind. We help them remain relevant, articulate their expertise, and extend their influence—whether the goal is to hire, fundraise, build a brand, or create a category.

Our work is grounded in three principles:
• Authenticity: Capturing the leader’s true voice and perspective.
• Efficiency: Requiring as little as 90 minutes of their time per month.
• Measurability: Tracking progress with weekly KPIs and clear outcomes.

I work with CEOs, founders, and senior executives - often at high-growth companies with 50+ employees - who are defining their industries, scaling quickly, and hiring aggressively.

My path here has been shaped by diverse experiences:
• Officer aboard nuclear submarines, leading teams of more than 200 in high-stakes operations.
• Stanford MBA and serial entrepreneur, having founded and sold two companies.
• Host of Beyond the Uniform, the #1 iTunes podcast for military career transitions, with over 450 episodes.
• Former CEO of StoryBox, a marketing technology company funded by Google’s Eric Schmidt and used by more than 1,000 companies worldwide.

I believe that executives are among a company’s most underutilized assets, and when they show up as visible, credible thought leaders, they have an outsized impact on culture, recruiting, industry leadership, and legacy.",United States,"Denver, Colorado, United States",Entrepreneurs'​ Organization,https://www.linkedin.com/company/executive-presence-io,Executive Presence,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/47806_company_logo,2530,"250 Fillmore St, Denver, Colorado 80206, US","Denver, Colorado",2021,US,80909173,executivepresence.io,Privately Held,executive-presence-io,"Executive Presence is a premium executive communications firm helping top leaders build credibility and visibility through LinkedIn.

We work with CEOs and senior executives at high-growth companies to craft and share thought leadership that drives measurable business outcomes—whether that’s raising capital, hiring top talent, acquiring customers, or building brand awareness.

Our fully-managed service includes:
	•	Personalized content strategy
	•	High-quality content creation
	•	Analytics and performance optimization

Our team includes former consultants from McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and Accenture who bring strategic rigor and a deep understanding of executive positioning. We’ve helped 150+ CEOs and executives transform LinkedIn from a passive profile into a powerful platform for influence.

Here’s what most leaders don’t realize about LinkedIn:

1. People > Companies
Executives—not brand pages—are the best asset for building a company’s visibility. A well-positioned executive post generates more trust and engagement than a company announcement.

2. Educate, Don’t Sell
80% of what we create is educational. Sharing value through insights, frameworks, and stories builds a loyal audience—making the occasional company-focused post far more effective.

3. Original Content Wins
LinkedIn rewards native, original content. Reposts and links underperform. Our team helps you share your expertise in a voice that’s authentic, compelling, and algorithm-friendly.

4. Consistency is Key
To grow an audience and stay top-of-mind, executives should post 2–5 times per week. We make that cadence effortless.

As the Founder and CEO of RCG Mortgage, I’ve spent over a decade helping thousands of families achieve homeownership while building one of the most recognized independent brokerages in the country. Under my leadership, RCG has become known for its people-first culture, elite coaching systems, and commitment to developing top-producing loan officers who close with purpose.

What I’ve learned along the way is that leadership is holistic. The same systems that build high-performing teams also build stronger fathers, partners, and individuals. Whether scaling a mortgage company or growing a fatherhood movement, it’s about people, process, and purpose.

What I believe:
- Leadership starts at home. Who you are off the clock determines how far you’ll go on it.
- Growth requires structure. Systems, accountability, and discipline are the real unlocks for freedom.
- Legacy > Leverage. Building something that lasts matters more than chasing what’s trending.

What drives me:
- Creating Real Impact: Helping others achieve measurable results while staying aligned with what matters most.
- Pushing Boundaries: I don’t believe in balance; I believe in rhythm, knowing when to sprint, when to rest, and when to lead.

DadderUp is a premium community and lifestyle brand designed to redefine what it means to be a father. It’s where dads come together to support, challenge, and inspire each other to be their best every single day. Through intentional action, connection, and gamified engagement, DadderUp turns the role of “dad” into a movement that’s respected, celebrated, and legacy-driven.

Why We Exist
For too long, culture has reduced fatherhood to punchlines, memes, and outdated stereotypes. The image of the distracted, disengaged dad has been normalized, while the reality is that intentional, present fathers have a profound impact on their children, their families, and the generations that follow. DadderUp exists to flip that narrative, showing the world that being a great dad is one of the highest forms of success.

How We Do It
DadderUp provides a community platform where fathers can connect daily, track their “Dad Flex,” share wins, and hold each other accountable. Through the TEDAM (Together Each Dadder Achieves More), members engage in challenges, celebrate each other’s victories, and commit to making fatherhood an active, intentional pursuit.

What is Our Big Vision?
We aim to make “Dadder” a household term and to inspire a cultural shift where exceptional fatherhood is both aspirational and achievable for men everywhere.

Who is DadderUp For?
We are for intentional fathers who refuse to settle for stereotypes, DadderUp is the premium community and lifestyle platform that inspires daily action, fosters genuine connection, and gamifies the journey of becoming an exceptional dad. Unlike casual parenting advice or “dad joke” culture, DadderUp delivers a high-performance approach to fatherhood, combining accountability, shared wisdom, and a legacy-driven mindset that creates lasting impact for generations.",Professional Training and Coaching,2-10 employees,1,https://dadderup.com/sales/,2398,2938,"I help families and fathers achieve homeownership and personal growth, so they can build wealth, stability, and legacy.

I'm Sam, I created Finding Founders to learn from the life stories of the most successful people in the world  I've taken these learnings and coached entrepreneurs to build better businesses
Starting that podcast changed my life  Here's how

I was studying engineering at UCLA and hating it.

I wanted to explore my creativity, so I started a podcast interviewing my more entrepreneurial friends.

I called it Finding Founders.

I wanted the podcast to be more than just two people talking... so I decided to infuse it with music, sound effects, and voice over.

Before I knew it I was talking to the founders of companies like Bulletproof Coffee, MasterClass, and Soylent...

I built up a team of 50 around me to help produce more impactful stories.

We traveled to Puerto Rico after the hurricanes and Cabo to cover ecotourism. We've interviewed drug dealers, leaders in the psychedelic movement, and celebrity chefs.

This has all showed me that a small side project can turn into something that can completely change your life.

Currently CEO & CTO at Luum, where we're reimagining how buildings get powered and controlled through X-PoE, a safer, smarter, low-voltage platform for lighting and beyond.

While of course also navigating global logistics, UL certification, and investor expectations.

But I don’t just build systems — I build stories. Whether it’s prototyping a better LED dimmer, restoring a 47’ sailboat for charter, or turning shipping delays into comic strips, I believe the best tech is human, and the best teams are honest, fast, and a little over-caffeinated.

With nearly 20 years of transformation leadership, including scaling Rackspace to $3B+ and IPO, preparing EA Games for flawless launches, and helping Wyndham cut operating costs by 40%, I’ve seen firsthand what happens when growth outpaces infrastructure.

Our company focuses on adding safety, confidence and education to diabetic care routines.

ExpressionMed began in the Summer of 2015 with the mission to create adhesives for wearable devices that were as fun as they were functional. After two years of research we found the perfect tape for longevity and comfort. Our company began sales in November in 2016 by offering patches for Insulin Pumps, and shortly after we introduced Dexcom tapes into our product line. We are excited to have expanded our product mix to include adhesives for Enlite, Libre, Pod and Medtronic CGMs.

According to our customer surveys, our adhesives will stay on for 10 days to ""3+ weeks"" without fraying or lifting. Our material is thin and breathes with your skin so you don't feel it as you move throughout the day.  Our tape has been worn on everyone from a busy dad of five to a competitive swimmer.

More inspiring than the product itself, the people I've met through this process have been amazing. Every parent who knows that diabetes isn't a lifestyle change for a child, but a whole family; every energetic kid that doesn't let a disease stop them from doing what they want to do; and every person who has faced difficult times and bounced back more confident and happy than people who can't imagine what diabetes is.

Turns out it’s not more water... it’s more electrolytes in your water that’s the unlock. So we built Hyro — a hydration brand backed by athletes, creators, and operators like Sarah’s Day, Quade Cooper, Daly Cherry-Evans and other legends.

Since launch, we’ve cracked multi-seven figures, built an all-star team, moved offices (twice), had a baby, got married- and we’re just getting started.

Before Hyro, I was co-founder & CEO of Shine Drink — we scaled to 7,000+ stores, hit $60M+ in retail sales, and won a Telstra Business Award along the way. I also built a Facebook Marketplace-style app before Facebook did (RIP FaceBuy).

- understand what your money is doing now
- learn the types of investments that suit your lifestyle
- examine where you have money to invest (you'd be surprised!)
- explore the investment income your money can generate

At SuGo Capital we educate with The Confident Investor Summit and we also work with those interested in making their money work harder and smarter.  We have investments that offer w-2 tax benefits like oil and gas and real estate, and we also offer newer types of investments - leveraged trading with a bot I've built.

Rewire. Build. Scale.

Our lead investigational product is laromestrocel (Lomecel-B), which is derived from culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are sourced from bone marrow of young healthy adult donors. We believe that by using the same cells that promote tissue repair, organ maintenance, and immune system function, we can develop safe and effective therapies for some of the most difficult diseases and conditions associated with aging.
Our clinical development programs have delivered several positive initial results across 5 clinical trials in 3 indications:  Phase 1 & 2 in Alzheimer’s Disease, Phase 1 & 2 in Aging-related Frailty, Phase 1 in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), a rare pediatric disease.  We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase2b clinical trial in HLHS. Our mission is to advance laromestrocel (Lomecel-B) and other cell-based product candidates into pivotal trials, with the goal of achieving regulatory approvals, subsequent commercialization and broad use by the healthcare community.
Our philosophy is that healthy aging can be improved through regenerative medicine approaches. Life expectancy has substantially increased over the past century as a result of medical and public health advancements. However, this increase in longevity has not been paralleled by the number of years a person is expected to live in relatively good health, free of chronic disease and disabilities of aging – a period known as healthspan. As we age, we experience a profound decline, in both number and function, in our own MSCs, a decrease in immune system function, decline in blood vessel functioning, chronic inflammation and other issues.

Not just a business, but a product with real impact. That clarity landed for me one morning, when I asked myself: If I made it all the way to the top here, would I be happy and satisfied? The answer was no. I knew I had to make a change.

The corporate world gave me incredible exposure. I learned how to lead and how to navigate complex, high-pressure environments. But it limited the impact I could make on the world. I wanted to create, not just optimise. I wanted to deliver value, not just extract it.

Entrepreneurship offered a different kind of challenge: the chance to lead through inspiration, to assemble a team that believed in a shared mission and to test whether I could not only envision a better way, but actually deliver it. So I left to build something different. Something better.

That is Aslan, a payroll-embedded reward provider designed to deliver fairer financial services to employees and cut compensation costs for employers. It gives employees more control, flexibility and value from the money they earn — while helping employers make cost savings, boost retention and offer a benefit people use 30x a month, on average.

We’re on a mission to change how people experience their salaries, with fairness, clarity and rewards built in by design. For CFOs and HR leaders, that means turning payroll into a strategic tool that reduces National Insurance, makes rewards more efficient and keeps teams engaged.

Shotgun writes codebase-aware specs for your AI coding agents so they don't derail and build what you want.

The Problem: Your AI agent (Cursor, Lovable, Claude Code) starts strong, then loses context and goes off-rails. You spend hours re-prompting because it doesn't understand your existing codebase. You're stuck in iteration hell—not because AI is bad, but because it's working without the right prep work.

How Shotgun Works (it does what your AI agent needs but can't do itself):
1. Index your entire codebase
2. Research how features should fit your architecture
3. Generate technical specs with full context baked in
4. Break down implementation into clear tasks
5. Export to whatever AI coding agent you use

The result: Your AI agent builds entire features correctly instead of fragments that need constant correction.

What You Get
→ AI agents that work longer without derailing (sustained quality, not just speed)
→ Features that respect your existing architecture (no technical debt)
→ Stop re-explaining your codebase every time (index once, use everywhere)

Early users report: ""Made Cursor and Lovable basically one-shot the new features.""

What's Next:
We're building multiplayer mode for engineering teams and non-technical stakeholders—real-time collaboration on specs, web-based codebase research for PMs and EMs, shared context across the entire team.

Looking for design partners: CTOs scaling AI development who feel coordination pain.

- Sharing what I’ve learned from these experiences, as well as my own health journey, by launching a community based food platform called Cooking in Color, comprised of a Substack (cookingincolor.substack.com/subscribe) and recipe club (cookingincolor.co/free-recipes) with the goal of enabling everyone to eat real-food by cooking delicious, simple, and colorful meals at home.

I started deep in the guts of enterprise email with Zimbra. I joined early, lived in the forums, talked to thousands of admins, and helped grow it into a product that eventually got acquired and shipped to millions of users. That experience taught me how important it is to listen to customers who live in your product every day, not just the people who sign the contracts.

After Zimbra, I helped start Acompli, a mobile email app focused on people who live in Outlook and Exchange. We raised money, shipped quickly, and ended up building what became Outlook Mobile after Microsoft acquired us. In parallel, we built highly secure versions of the product for government customers, where the margin for error is essentially zero. That mix of consumer-grade usability and serious security shaped how I think about product design to this day.

From there, I went deeper into marketplaces and operations at Instacart. Before I took the job, I signed up as a shopper so I could feel the product from the other side. It is one thing to look at dashboards. It is another thing to climb three flights of stairs with someone’s groceries and see where the app helps or gets in the way. That experience reinforced a simple idea: you cannot build for people you never bother to stand next to.

Today, I am the Co-Founder of Pretty Good AI. We are focused on taking routine, repetitive work off medical practices' plates so doctors and staff can spend more time on patient care. Healthcare is full of smart, exhausted people, buried under systems that were never designed for how they actually work. I want to bring everything I learned from Zimbra, Acompli, Outlook, and Instacart into that world.

I like the part of the job where drawings meet real materials and ideas meet manufacturing reality. That’s where things get interesting and where experience helps cut through the noise. Over the years, I’ve been part of programs involving tiny components made from 0.0007-inch diameter wire, production scaling, rapid turnarounds under audit pressure, and design-for-manufacturing reviews that turned multi-month detours into a few weeks of efficient progress.

Most sourcing slowdowns aren’t about bad designs. They come from missing context: what’s realistic to measure, what’s truly scalable, where the dead ends have happened before, and why things take as long as they do (and sometimes why they don’t need to). That’s where I come in.

My work often involves helping teams anticipate manufacturability risks early so validation builds arrive with fewer surprises and fewer failed incoming inspections. I spend time on the floor, ask the right questions, and connect teams with suppliers who’ve already worked through similar challenges. Each project adds another layer of learning, and I bring that perspective to help others get there faster while staying aligned with the quality and traceability expectations medical programs demand.

I know what it feels like to chase success at the cost of your health and relationships.

After building businesses of my own and working with leaders across industries, I’ve seen the same pattern: success at the top often comes at the expense of health, relationships, or clarity of purpose. That’s why I created the Compound Leadership Framework, a system designed to align performance with fulfilment.

The framework focuses on three critical pillars:
Health — building resilience and peak energy to avoid burnout.
Wealth — compounding time, capital, and decisions for long-term growth.
Relationships — deepening trust and influence to shape lasting legacy.

I work with leaders facing high-pressure decisions and complex transitions, from scaling a company to preparing for an exit or pursuing their “Second Mountain” of purpose. My role isn’t just to coach, but to act as a strategic partner who stands beside you, helping you navigate the hidden pressures of leadership without losing what matters most.

The best leaders don’t just deliver results, they design lives and businesses worth compounding. My clients are CEOs, founders, and senior executives navigating growth, exits, and legacy. They come to me when they need a trusted adviser to see blind spots, sharpen decisions, and create alignment across their personal and professional worlds.

As a founder of multiple companies, ranging from the real estate to the memorabilia space, Rogers considers his secret weapon to be his eye for talent. Being a business owner, Rogers knows what it takes and what makes a company successful.

As an entrepreneur, investor, leader, and music guru, Rogers embodies the spirit of a business owner. Rogers jumped into business at an early age, and in 2005 started what is now Texas’ largest independently owned real estate company, Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate. Since its inception, Rogers went on to be the founder of Rogers Healy and Associates Land and Lake, Rogers Healy and Associates Commercial Real Estate, Healy Global Real Estate and Relocation, and Healy Property Management.

As fate would have it, Rogers made his first investment in the world of Venture Capital in 2012, in Mizzen + Main. He fell in love with the idea of connecting the dots in the world of VC. After over a decade of investing in deals ranging from CPG to SaaS, Rogers founded Morrison Seger Venture Capital Partners. “MoSe” quickly made a name for themselves, with early-stage investments in companies ranging from tequila to trading cards, and have been able to add a new layer of experience to venture capitalism.

Most importantly, Rogers lives a life of faith, alongside his wife Abby, their daughters Henley and Collins (named after Eagles’ frontman, Don Henley, and Phil Collins), their son Winwood (named after musician Steve Winwood), and their dogs and all their music memorabilia. Rogers has one of the largest collections of music memorabilia in the world.

At Play Verto, we’re pioneering the use of play-based research and the art of gamification to transform how people engage with questions that matter.

We then bring those insights into the heart of strategy – weaving lived experience with the knowledge and capabilities of leaders to catalyse real impact. Our inclusive platform supports 60+ languages and achieves an 80% average completion rate – three times higher than traditional survey platforms – delivering data that is representative, actionable, and credible.

We manage and operate one of the most respected fleets in the business, and I’m proud to say we built it one owner and one aircraft at a time—by staying relentlessly focused on service, integrity, and execution.

My path here was anything but linear. I was born into a middle-class family outside Chicago, raised by two small-business owner parents who believed in hard work and showing up. I grew up an athlete, and I’ve carried that same discipline and drive into every chapter of my life. I always imagined I’d run a creative agency—something that shaped how people see and experience the world. Looking back, I realize I was always chasing something bigger than a career: I wanted to live a full life. That meant carving my own path.

I spent over 15 years growing inside a company I loved, starting young and rising through the ranks by observing, learning, and never waiting for permission. But as much as I cherished the journey—and the people who became family—I knew I wasn’t built to stay in one lane. After we took the company private, I walked away from a secure future because I didn’t want to tell my young daughter that her dad was a one-trick pony. That wasn’t the story I was here to write.

So I stepped out—with no shortage of fire, a non-compete over my head, and a deep conviction that I was just getting started. I had short but formative stints with two iconic brands, helped launch several startups (including two belonging to my wife), and ultimately found the right partner to build a business with.

Zenflight is a reflection of everything I’ve learned—and everything I believe in. We operate with precision, move with purpose, and serve people who expect the best. When our managed aircraft aren't flying their owners, we charter them to a select client base. For everything else, we run a high-touch brokerage business that puts transparency and excellence first.

Outside of work, I’m a husband to the most brilliant woman I know, and a father to two fearless girls who keep me grounded and inspired. Travel is in our blood—we’ve made the world our classroom, our playground, and our office. That global perspective is one of my greatest assets, and it’s deeply shaped the way I lead.

After the emergence of Bangladesh the businesses flourished a little under the banner of Aman Trading Corporation. But it was in the late 1980s that the businesses in trading through importing various consumer items and their marketing started witnessing a steady growth in the business. At some point in the mid 1980s the Group think tank felt that mere trading business and earning wealth through that activity may bring prosperity to individuals of the family only. But as a well placed family in the society the social obligation to the poor rural mass for doing something for their economic upliftment was pricking their conscience. This greatly influenced to think about ventures where investment can generate employment for the rural mass whatever may be the size of generated employment. At the first instance some agro-based industries were thought of. This led to establishment of cold storages in the northern Bangladesh. This further continued with the establishment of a cement grinding industry. At the advent of 21st century formation of a Group with the trading houses, contractual firms working individually under the banner of Aman Trading Corporation & few industries like cold storages & one cement-grinding mill with a corporate character was completed. With the sharp changes in the socio-economic situation of the country the Group vowed to tap the prevailing scopes for establishment of industries. At the same time Group realized that in order to expedite the works of establishment of medium and large-scale industries, availing the facilities offered by the Government and for easier correspondences with the agencies of theirs as well as to avail quick banking facilities the shifting of the Corporate Office from Rajshahi to capital city Dhaka was unavoidable. The Group therefore decided to participate in the process of industrialization in the places wherefrom marketing, transportation would be easier, generation of income & employment will be evident and in doing so shall pay taxes to the Government. With this end in view the Group in the year 2004 housed a miniature Registered Office in Motijheel Commercial Area leaving behind a strong Regional Office at Rajshahi to look after the existing industries activities there. In the year 2007' the Group housed its Corporate Office at Uttara Model Town for controlling the entire activities of the business & industrial units including the Registered at Motijheel & the Regional Office at Dhaka.

Sounds too good to be true? It’s not—let me show you how.

At HouseHack Seattle, we’re all about helping you create wealth through smart, creative real estate strategies. Real estate is still one of the best ways to build long-term, generational wealth, and we’ve mastered a few strategies that can help you get there faster.

 Here’s what we focus on:

HouseHacking Buy a property with extra bedrooms or units, live in one, and rent the rest. The rent covers your mortgage and expenses, so you live for free. With down payments as low as $20k, this strategy helped my wife, Jess, and me reach a $2 million net worth before we turned 30. It’s a game-changer!

 Short-Term Rentals (Airbnb) Short-term rentals are one of the hottest trends in real estate right now. With travel booming and Airbnb loans available with as little as 10% down, investing in vacation rentals can bring in big cash flow. Imagine owning multiple vacation homes that generate income while you sleep. It’s not just a dream—it’s something we help our clients do every day

 Long-Term Rentals Even with changing market conditions, long-term rentals are still a great way to build passive income. And we’re not just doing the basics—we specialize in adding value through ADUs, DADUs, rehabs, and tiny homes to give you above-average returns

 BRRRR Strategy Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. This strategy lets you recycle your money and acquire multiple properties while other investors are still working on their first one. We’ve used this strategy to scale our portfolio, and we help our clients do the same

 Off-Market Deals In today’s competitive market, we leave no stone unturned. We work directly with sellers, through mail and calls, to find off-market deals that others miss. If you’re looking for the best opportunities, we’ve got you covered

HouseHack Seattle isn’t just a real estate agency—we’re active investors, house hackers, and passionate about what we do. Jess and I have personally completed four house hacks and own 5 long-term rentals and 5 short-term rentals.
Every member of our team has lived and breathed these strategies, so we know what works.

Real estate has given us the freedom to live life on our own terms, and we want to help you do the same. If you’re ready to build wealth through real estate, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.

For 12+ years, I have built and scaled organizations by understanding that hiring the right people, deploying them effectively, creating a structure where they can thrive, and optimizing their utilization does not belong to any one group or department.  Rather, it is the core of business performance.

My approach is different because:
--I serve as fractional Operations Leader and CPO for clients, which means I see how people strategy and operations must work together to drive growth.
--I forecast revenue budgets, own career ladders, and sit on executive teams because talent strategy IS business strategy.
--I have experience as a system SME and I build reporting dashboards that connect recruiting metrics to business performance.

In order to thrive, mankind needs trees in urban spaces. But, trees have always battled to survive in cities, with no economically or arboriculturally viable solution. The problem was clear. And, determined to make a difference, Ben founded Citygreen to solve it.

Today, his vision remains powerfully simple: a world where sustainable green space is within the reach of every person, every day – and natural resources are utilized (not wasted) for the benefit of mankind and measurable environmental impacts.

From his dedication to research and development, and hands-on experience in the field, comes a firm belief that there are ways of successfully harnessing, filtering, and storing our scarce water resources close to the source, providing means to make our cities greener and more liveable.

Informed by this belief and Ben’s natural inclination for problem solving, Citygreen offers engineered green building systems to improve urban planting success and increase forest canopy in urban areas. These solutions are best practice in their field and endorsed by professional organisations around the globe, putting Citygreen at the cutting edge of sustainable tree pit solutions for cities.

Even the most sophisticated borrowers and lenders relied on spreadsheets, legal docs, and email threads to handle hundreds of millions in credit. The inefficiencies weren’t just frustrating; they also introduced risk, slowed down deals, and limited transparency for all parties.

With Finley, we’re building the tools I wish we had back then on both sides of the table: software that helps lenders and borrowers manage corporate debt data, workflows, and analysis.

Earlier in my career, I was a consultant at Oliver Wyman, advising global institutions through the Financial Services and Education practices. That experience gave me a front-row seat to how critical systems transformation is in enabling innovation - especially in highly regulated, capital-intensive sectors.

I’m a proud graduate of The University of Texas at Austin - Hook’em Horns!  With a deep understanding of credit markets and enterprise software, I’m passionate about building infrastructure that makes capital more accessible, auditable, and intelligently deployed.

Failed as a founder of three prior startups
Failed to get my PhD (to my parents’ disappointment)
Failed at 'family'—divorced single mum by 30
Failed at pitching VCs—800 NOs before my first YES funding Zamna
Failed to ask for help—was briefly homeless
These failures shaped me as a first-generation immigrant turned CEO and humanitarian. I share them in keynotes and workshops that inspire action, blending lessons from:

Leading Zamna, the AI company revolutionising global aviation
Founding Sunflower Relief, which raised £3M+ for life-saving aid in Ukraine
Balancing five kids while breaking barriers in male-dominated industries

Little bit about me

I'm an 18 year old entrepreneur, that has always had the business mindset. Going into Spring 2020, my high school life turned on its head. Couldn't wait to go back to school after Spring Break, to be then told to stay home for 2 weeks, if we only knew what really was about to occur.

Without being in school, the possibilities were endless.

16 years old with absolutely all the time in the world. While most of my classmates used this time to just play video games and sleep, I used this time as an advantage to start learning this whole business thing.

From flipping sneakers, microwaves (ask me about this when we talk), and even more, there was nothing holding me back except the outside world.

17 year old me learned something -- everyone has a need for different problems to be solved and everyone is (hopefully) always looking for solutions. It's all about getting into the right conversations with the people who have the problems you fix.

With this realization, I got obsessed with attention/conversations. In today's world (without the outside world as much), how do we find these people and start the conversations?

That's what I immersed my self in.

Why Work with Prestige?

1. Simple - Unlike other factors, we do not require that clients factor all of their invoices. Clients choose which customers and which invoices to factor based on their need for either cash or credit protection. All non-factored cash we receive will be returned without any fees. The only fees we charge are factoring fees, a one-time application fee, and wire transfer fees.

2. Fast - No other factor can close faster than Prestige Capital. We have funded transactions in as little as three business days from the initial phone call. The average transaction, however, takes between 4 and 5 business days to fund. We are able to accomplish this because we focus on the quality of the clients’ customers and the ability to verify invoices, rather than on the clients’ financial condition.

3. Straightforward - We maintain the highest level of professionalism, integrity, and transparency. Our fee structure is very simple and there are no hidden charges or ambiguous language in our contracts.

Additionally, there are:
NO Minimum Factoring Fees
NO Long Term Contract Requirements (as short as 3 months)
NO Closing Costs (other than a one-time due diligence fee)
NO Traditional Personal Guarantees
NO Financial Statement Requirements
NO Operational Audits
NO Legal Fees
NO Minimum Invoice Fees
NO Obligation to Sell All Receivables. You choose which receivables to fund.

4.

To quote Terry Pratchett in a Hat Full of Sky: ""Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.""

The challenge is that travel is hard. The pandemic has made it even more challenging. It can feel like you need a degree in logistics to plan more than a simple trip.

Travel is also deeply personal and human. Review sites and booking engines make the actual process of booking easy, but are case studies in the paradox of choice. Information overload results in countless hours of research and a lingering feeling of uncertainty: how similar to me are these reviewers?

If you haven't worked with a 'travel agent', you might think of them as a relic of the past. It's true, that agents today are no longer a requirement to book a ticket like they once were. Instead, travel advisors (as they're now called) act more as a trusted advisor combining local knowledge and experience with their understanding of your values and priorities to craft the perfect trip.

The technology that powers the modern travel advisor hasn't kept up with the tools available to consumers. Advisors are left juggling multiple antiquated and fragmented systems. Not only is this frustrating, but it comes at a real cost of business. Disconnected systems can result in lost commissions and a compromised traveler experience.

Quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death. Run to the roar.
Set God-sized goals. Pursue God-given passions.
Go after a dream that is destined to fail without divine intervention.
Stop pointing out problems. Become part of the solution.
Stop repeating the past. Start creating the future.
Face your fears. Fight for your dreams.
Grab opportunity by the mane and don’t let go!
Live like today is the first day and last day of your life.
Burn sinful bridges. Blaze new trails.
Live for the applause of nail-scarred hands.
Don’t let what’s wrong with you keep you from worshiping what’s right with God.
Dare to fail. Dare to be different.
Quit holding out. Quit holding back. Quit running away.

I scale organizations from startup through $10B+ IPO with discipline, speed, and culture intact. My focus: investor-ready governance, executive bench strength, and unlocking performance through accountability and compassion.

Over 20+ years, I’ve partnered with CEOs and boards to build People functions that deliver measurable results. I believe high performance is achieved when governance is strong, leadership is prepared, and culture enables people to thrive. Care and compassion aren’t the goal — but they are how you create accountability, engagement, and discretionary effort at scale.

At Datadog, I scaled the company from 160 to 2,400+ employees across 30 countries, building the People function from scratch and preparing the company for IPO. My role included designing innovative compensation and equity programs to attract and retain top talent in a competitive market, transitioning equity from options to RSUs, and establishing executive comp aligned with investor expectations. I also implemented governance processes that satisfied auditors and regulators, while launching progressive change management and communications programs so employees understood what going public meant for them. Through this period of hypergrowth, we sustained engagement above 90% worldwide.

At Cognism, I partnered with the CEO and board to restore governance, re-architect the executive team, and simultaneously professionalize the People function. I rebuilt the HR leadership bench across talent, rewards, and operations, implemented global controls for compensation and promotions, and launched forward-looking manager training that boosted effectiveness across the company. I also introduced progressive policies such as global parental leave, ESG reporting, and structured DEI training — strengthening compliance and culture together. These interconnected efforts stabilized the business, restored investor confidence, and positioned the company for its next stage of growth.

What drives me now is helping CEOs and boards navigate the critical challenges of growth: scaling without breaking culture, building strong leadership pipelines, ensuring investor-ready governance, and guiding organizations through the workforce disruption of technology and AI.

I started with no resources, no connections, and didn’t have access to the playbooks that would have made the journey 10X easier.

As a kid, I made money garden landscaping for families at church, manufacturing merchandise for private clubs, and then developing websites and running ad campaigns for local companies.

By 21, I was founding companies. In the decade since, I've:

➤ Generated $300M+ in revenue
➤ Built operations in 1,000+ U.S. cities
➤ Served over 3 million customers globally
➤ Helped grow hundreds of small businesses
➤ Raised $30M+ in capital from Angels, VCs, Private Equity, and Family Offices
➤ Successfully navigated both successful and failed multimillion-dollar acquisitions
➤ Been featured in leading publications like Forbes, Bloomberg, Entrepreneur, USA Today and more
➤ Worked with and advised the world's most iconic brands, including Diageo, Mars, Tesco, 7-Eleven, AB-InBev, Molson Coors, and Constellation

BUT, the journey was hard (harder than it needed to be).

I’ve faced many of the things you don't think about when starting a company:

→ Fought off (and won) predatory lawsuits
→ Closed a Seed round days after my wedding
→ Negotiated with demanding government agencies
→ Worked with lobbyists to introduce or change legislation
→ Raised a Series A while in the hospital for my first son's birth
→ Navigated a failed multi-million dollar merger while my daughter was born
→ Survived near-extinction events where we had single-digit weeks or days to save the company

The 2008 Financial Crisis, coupled with the corruption of the banks and Wall Street to illegally and improperly secure new loans, displaced millions of homeowners and their families. After many years as a Real Estate and Business Law Firm specialist, I decided to begin my own practice with a focus on Foreclosure Law and Real Estate Litigation. Having worked for both large and medium-sized Bay Area firms, I was exposed to the huge overhead costs most firms today charge their clients. I knew I could provide clients with the highest level of representation while not charging the enormous overhead if I opened my own practice.

I am very proud of our efforts not only as Real Estate litigation experts but also as a law firm dedicated to preserving the rights of homeowners against the Big Banks. When a property is illegally foreclosed upon, people have rights, and we are here to enforce those rights for them.

With over a 90% success rate in helping families facing imminent foreclosure stay in their homes, we are continuing our focus to undue the damages caused by the Financial Crisis and prepare for the next housing crises.

I help organizations build the structures, systems, and decision frameworks that move strategy from slide decks into scalable execution.

Across my career, I've led transformation efforts in Fortune 100 enterprises and scaling startups, shaping executive talent pipelines, workforce design, and organizational planning at global scale. I’ve seen how strategy often breaks down, not because the ideas were wrong, but because the operating reality couldn’t support them.

That experience led me back to school. Today, I’m completing my Master’s in Strategic Management at Harvard University to expand the way I shape enterprise outcomes, blending academic frameworks with operating insight to help companies realign around performance, resilience, and growth.

 Here at ZIZO we reduce employee attrition and improve ROI in sales departments by gamifying the internal sales processes- making work as fun as playing a video game.

I founded ZIZO on a vision to make work as fun, competitive, and challenging for next-generation workers as playing their favorite video game. Think about your employees walking into work every day and logging into their console to face new opponents, win new bonus features and battle alongside their allies for grand prizes.

All of my initiatives would fail without my team- to whom I attribute my success and growth. Our team is built around the pillars of accountability, agility, trust, professionalism, and communication.

As a manager, you can use ZIZO to:

Rewards and Recognition Based Management System - The data from gamification insights support creating personalized programs that receive better adoption and response.
Manage Performance in Real-Time - You provide on-spot feedback by giving evidence of personalized benchmarks, milestones, performance KPIs.
Create a Competitive Environment in Your Workplace - You can arrange team competitions, set collaborative goals, organize battle royale tournaments, and much more. You can challenge your employees to achieve targets for earning currencies that they can use to purchase tangible items, office perks, digital assets, and even align with bonuses.
Improve Levels and Ranks of Your Employees - It lets your employees see a well-defined career path, how to get there, and what level they’ll achieve after completing tasks.
Get Actionable Insights Through AI - You can integrate, import, access, store and map all your business data in one place and access it through a customizable dashboard.

My books include:

 American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company
 Red Teaming: How Your Business Can Conquer the Competition Challenging Everything

I am one of the world's foremost experts on decision-support red teaming, a revolutionary methodology developed by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies to help leaders make better decisions in today's complex and rapidly changing world.

In 2017, I founded Red Team Thinking to teach individuals and organizations around the world around the world how to use this same approach to:

 Engage critical thinking
 Enable distributed decision making
 Encourage diversity of thought

Why? Because who thinks wins!

I also coach senior executives using the management principles I learned from my mentor, legendary CEO Alan Mulally.

 I also like to talk – about leadership. In fact, Inc. Magazine named me one of its “Top 100 Leadership Speakers.”

In 2021, I launched ""The Thinking Leader Podcast"" so that I could keep talking during the pandemic.

I had seen so many families eager to build their dream home and saw that eagerness turn to frustration through a process that didn’t include the most important part- the people living in their home. I knew there was a better way to help Iowan’s with the home building process and that is exactly why we consider ourselves the best Customer Service Company in Iowa, it just so happens that we also build the best homes. Our process starts with YOU first and at the center of the entire build. I set out with the goal to help you design the home of your dreams, while we may build many homes in a year, there is only one that matters to you.  From that first home that I completed in 2003 to the wide range of homes we have built since then one thing remains; they all have my name on it. That means everything to me personally and it shows in how we deliver for our customers.

Every single person who is involved in the process of building your dream home from the first conversation to the golden nail shares my passion for service. This is why we offer the longest and most extensive warranty in Iowa, the most options available without being charged an “upgrade” fee, 3 professional movers for 8 hours on the day of your move and so much more. The process doesn’t need to be stressful or full of anxiety when you work with Happe Homes. We have been building homes for 2 decades, and yes things may go wrong along the way, since there is no “perfect build”, that is why partnering with the right builder who delivers in those times is so important. We take care of the variables for you, because that is what you deserve. That is why I am proud to put my Family’s Name on every single home that we build and it would be my honor to have your family create a lifetime of memories in a Happe Home.

I mean come on, its HAPPE Homes, don’t you think that sets the standard right there?!

After spending 5 months traveling from South Africa to Kenya, I understood how urgently we need solutions to tackle the climate crisis.

We often experienced floodings & droughts. Bridges were wiped away, roads were blocked, and people were displaced by the disasters.

We have less than 2500 days left until we can no longer keep the 1.5-degree global warming target.

If we want our children to experience nature in the way we do today, we have to curb emissions NOW.

But how can we REALLY do more against emissions than taking the train, recycling waste, and picking McVegan over the Big Mac at McDonald's?

Good question.

Fortunately, having the experience of:

• Growing my deep learning company from zero to 7-figures
• Raising millions from worldwide investors
• Making one exit

…I had the financial means, the knowledge, and the courage to start a company with the goal of shaving 14.5% of the world's CO2 emissions within a decade.

Today, we're not short of energy, it's just produced in places we don't consume it.

By mass-producing hydrogen carriers from green energy, we close the geographical gap between production and consumption.

We start with manufacturing renewable natural gas, as it can be used without any change of infrastructure.

Within a year, our solution helps companies cut their emissions by up to 90%, all while ensuring stable supply of green energy.

It’s not too late to make an impact for our children -but we have to act now.

If you are a chemical engineer, mechanical engineer, investor, or policymaker, and you want to:

 Do more for Ukraine than hanging out a flag outside your window
 Make sure no one needs to freeze or file bankruptcy in the coming winters
 Solve humanity's biggest challenge, the climate crisis

Then send me a message with one sentence about where your superpower lies.

After a satisfying career leading modernisation & agility in the accounting industry, I now focus my energy on wealth empowerment for women. My mission is simple: championing badass women entrepreneurs & master-mental-load-jugglers who fearlessly take on life's challenges. Together, we're a force to be reckoned with!

I co-founded the AI Women Circle with the fabulous Inbal Rodnay, a kickass community where women in professional services (like yourself ;) ) thrive in the exciting world of AI. Our mission is clear: unleash women's potential with AI while prioritising ethical practices.

The start of my accounting journey at a Top 100 firm left me craving a better way. Endless typing & mind-numbing tasks? No thanks. I wanted more: meaningful conversations, proactive future planning & awe-inspiring stories, not just numbers. So, I dove into technology to streamline service delivery, tapped into data-driven insights, and built emotional intelligence to forge genuine human connections. And let me tell you, the fire inside me was blazing!

Can I share a little success story? One of my proudest achievements was leading the development of a future-fit accounting division at a national mid-tier firm in Australia. We created an unparalleled client experience, leveraging technology & data-driven strategies to blow minds.

The best part? Being a role model and mentor to fierce, independent women lights up my soul. As a devoted mum to Tayah and Avery, I've learned the true importance of nurturing the next generation of powerhouses. They are the future, and I'm here to guide and inspire them every step of the way. My journey has been fueled by an unwavering commitment to driving positive change and empowering women. This path?

For 42 years, I've dedicated my legal career to helping the sick and injured tell their stories to skeptical insurance companies. For the past 25+ years, I've specialized in long-term disability claims, helping clients secure benefits they've paid for and deserve.

MY LTD EXPERTISE:
✓ Successfully challenging denied claims nationwide
✓ Fighting pre-existing condition exclusions applied incorrectly
✓ Overturning denials where insurance companies question medical evidence
✓ Representing clients through appeals and litigation

What sets my practice apart: I've seen every strategy insurance companies use to minimize or deny valid claims. This allows me to anticipate their moves and build stronger cases from the start.

BEYOND DISABILITY LAW:
As founder of Great Legal Marketing, I've spent 20+ years helping solo and small firm attorneys build profitable practices. Through coaching, books, and my Renegade Lawyer Podcast, I share strategies that let lawyers serve clients while building the lifestyle they want.

PUBLISHED WORKS:
 ""Renegade Lawyer Marketing""
 ""Great Legal Marketing""
 ""No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs"" (with Dan Kennedy)
 You, a Teenage Soccer Referee

SPEAKING & MEDIA:
 Host of Renegade Lawyer Podcast
 Featured on 125+ podcasts and publications

MY APPROACH:
I believe in fighting for what's right while building a practice that supports the life I want. This philosophy has allowed me to represent clients while raising 9 children (4 adopted from China), fostering 60+ rescue dogs, and continuing to referee soccer games.

EDUCATION:
 George Mason University Law School (now Antonin Scalia School of Law)
 Former William & Mary soccer scholarship recipient
 1976 National Youth Soccer Champion

Through the Ben Glass Center for Growth and Innovation, I provide quarterly coaching and mentoring to attorneys across the US and Canada on building thriving practices with work-life balance.

MY PHILOSOPHY:
""You have one life to live. Every moment matters and your life is supposed to be lived for your happiness.""

HOW I CAN HELP:

FOR LTD CLAIMS: If your long-term disability claim has been denied, I offer consultations to discuss your options and rights.

FOR ATTORNEYS: Looking to grow your practice or improve your marketing? I provide coaching, resources, and proven strategies.

After studying commercial tourism at the University of Utah, I launched into the online startup world leading UI and UX development for two large e-commerce platforms. After the .com bubble burst in 2001 and funding dried up, I further fueled my love of international travel by backpacking around the world for a year. Upon returning, I brought my internet marketing knowledge to the hospitality arena and began an extensive career as an executive leader in hotel and property management marketing and operations. In 2007, I received an MBA from Westminster College, which further fueled my passion for entrepreneurship. During my continued hotel hospitality tenure, I started and sold two successful property management companies, one in San Diego, CA, and one in Santa Fe, NM. And finally, in 2010, while collaborating with the Sundance Film Festival, I observed their challenges relating to lodging and proposed creating a locally customized and community-supported booking engine. From the technology developed, RootRez was born.

These experiences led to a deep understanding of developing, leading, and executing company strategy. Along the way, I gained expertise in digital marketing, sales, project management, finance, budgeting, and web technologies. I'm dangerous in graphic and web development, but I can't claim to be a designer.

When I'm not in my office chair, you can often find me in a bike saddle. I continue to be an endurance mountain bike and road racer (aka, glutton for punishment). I have completed 10 Leadville 100 mountain bike races as a top competitor, along with many other painfully illogical accomplishments.

In 2016, I observed that Park City lacked a community bike club, despite being full of passionate cyclists. Seeing the unmet need, I founded and launched Stay Park City Cycling, an all-inclusive club for all levels, from elite racers to weekend warriors of all ages. While I knew there was a need, the success has been overwhelming. We are now the largest cycling club in the state, consisting of over 400 paying members and a host of supportive and amazing sponsors. The club operates on the backs of dozens of incredible sponsors who lead rides, host socials, and promote safety and cycling stewardship in the community.

Principle 1 - To whom much is given, much is required. I believe that if any individual has been given the gift of a sound mind and/or a sound body, it is incumbent upon them to be productive member of society and plant the trees in whose shade they shall never sit.

Principle 2 - “There is no way around hard work. Embrace it. You have to put in the hours because there’s always something which you can improve."" by Roger Federer

Principle 3 - Play the long game. Always assume you may have repeated interactions with any individual you meet. Even if others are not willing to play a long game with you, you should seek to play the long game with others. Life is long, and yet Silicon Valley and the world keeps getting smaller!

Initially, I balanced business operations by day and teaching classes by night, focusing on creating engaging educational experiences. This approach led us to become one of the nation's largest LSAT prep providers, consistently achieving top score improvements.

In 2018, we partnered with New Harbor Capital and acquired Next Step Test Prep. By early 2020, we rebranded it as Blueprint MCAT, launching a suite of products on our industry-leading LMS. Transitioning to online education, we maintained our commitment to delivering fun, high-quality learning experiences featuring talented instructors, modern interfaces, deep analytics, and engaging tools, all aimed at driving superior score increases.

Our dedication to innovation and student success has garnered significant recognition. In 2023, Blueprint Prep was honored as the ""Overall Career Prep Company of the Year"" in the EdTech Breakthrough Awards, reflecting our impact on education technology. Additionally, we earned a spot on the 2023 Inc. 5000 list, ranking at No. 2105 among America's fastest-growing private companies.

In complex B2B software sales — especially in security, DevOps, and infrastructure — buyers ask deep technical questions early. When an SE isn’t on the call, AEs often defer, credibility dips, and deals stall with “let’s bring an SE next time.” That slows cycles, increases SE burnout, and drags down win rates.

Our Virtual SE solves this. It joins every Zoom/Teams call silently and equips your AE with real-time, 3-second answers to technical, product, and competitive questions — all sourced from your company’s own documentation and knowledge base. Reps stay credible in discovery, SEs focus on late-stage POCs, and deals keep momentum.

Why teams use Virtual SE:

Faster AE ramp: New hires sound credible from week one.

Increased win rate: AEs handle objections on the spot, instead of deferring.

Better SE coverage: Free scarce SEs from repetitive discovery calls.

Shorter cycles: No more waiting a week to “bring an SE back.”

Competitive edge: Real-time differentiation vs. rivals who still rely on static battlecards.

With DeltaGen, revenue leaders stop losing deals for lack of technical depth. Every AE runs first meetings with the confidence of a top SE — and every buyer gets answers when they matter most.

Our mission: Make technical credibility scalable. Instead of over-hiring or burning out SEs, give your sales team a Virtual SE that never misses a call.",Software Development,11-50 employees,6,https://deltagen.ai/,6227,9988,Founder & CEO | ex-BCG | Virtual SE for B2B Sales | Yale & Dartmouth | Techstars

I’m Michael Daehne, Founder & CEO of FlexPoint Consulting.

𝐖𝐡𝐨 𝐈 𝐀𝐦
LinkedIn says I’m a consultant…but like most of us, there’s more to the story!

I’m a problem solver, a team builder, a strategic thinker, and a people-first leader. Most importantly, I’m a husband and a dad. I live in Austin, TX, where I spend my free time chasing our kiddo and Golden Retriever around, cooking, listening to live music, volunteering with several nonprofit organizations, and rooting for my beloved Texas Longhorns (Hook ’em!).

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐃𝐨
Professionally, I’ve spent my whole career helping organizations large and small navigate transformation and implement innovative solutions that result in happy customers, engaged employees, and thriving businesses. I’ve built a reputation as a creative problem solver, a trusted advisor, and someone who brings clarity and momentum to big, complex efforts.

In 2021, I launched FlexPoint Consulting on the premise that there is a better way to support clients on their transformation journeys. Like a lot of consulting firms, we help clients envision, plan, and deliver business transformation—often through the implementation of modern technology. What makes us different is how we go about it. Our “better way” is guided by four key principles:

1.	We empower and equip our clients to succeed after we’re gone
2.	We prioritize the “people stuff” that usually makes or breaks major change initiatives
3.	We take the time to get to know you and co-create solutions 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ you
4.	We focus on lasting value vs. billing hours

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈’𝐦 𝐏𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭
If there’s a through line in my career, it’s this: I love helping people grow. Whether it’s coaching a team member, advising a client, or navigating a complex change effort, I’ve always had a knack—and a deep passion—for empowering others to thrive.

That shows up in how I lead at FlexPoint: building a team of curious, capable, values-driven consultants. And it shows up in how we work with clients, guiding them through change that can feel messy or intimidating, and helping them come out stronger on the other side. I’m at my best when I’m playing the role of coach, sounding board, strategist, and partner—helping others see what’s possible and collaborating to make it a reality.

• Gross margin → up (mix, pricing, leakage)
• SG&A → right-sized with accountability

From a young age, I was motivated, encouraged and learnt from my grandmother and mum, and as an adult I recognise the sacrifices they made as women to support our family, never having had the chance to develop their talents elsewhere. This is where my passion for diversity at work was born.

Changing the Game, our show launched in 2021, became a platform to celebrate and learn from amazing people whose stories show why diversity is good for business and how innovation can impact our world.

My career has afforded me the opportunity to have lived and worked in Brazil, America, and Australia, and travelled the world. These opportunities came with challenges, accelerated growth and an ever-expanding appreciation for the benefits of diversity and innovation.

As one of the co-founders of the Visagio Group in Australia, the team in Down Under and region has grown from day zero to an award-winning team of 100+ people. Our group is the one-stop-shop for business growth and transformation for 25+ clients from several industries. Now we will break grounds in corporate innovation with The Bakery which recently joined our group in the region.

To quote Terry Pratchett in a Hat Full of Sky: ""Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.""

The challenge is that travel is hard. The pandemic has made it even more challenging. It can feel like you need a degree in logistics to plan more than a simple trip.

Travel is also deeply personal and human. Review sites and booking engines make the actual process of booking easy, but are case studies in the paradox of choice. Information overload results in countless hours of research and a lingering feeling of uncertainty: how similar to me are these reviewers?

If you haven't worked with a 'travel agent', you might think of them as a relic of the past. It's true, that agents today are no longer a requirement to book a ticket like they once were. Instead, travel advisors (as they're now called) act more as a trusted advisor combining local knowledge and experience with their understanding of your values and priorities to craft the perfect trip.

The technology that powers the modern travel advisor hasn't kept up with the tools available to consumers. Advisors are left juggling multiple antiquated and fragmented systems. Not only is this frustrating, but it comes at a real cost of business. Disconnected systems can result in lost commissions and a compromised traveler experience.

Tern exists to change this by building an integrated platform that connects the modern travel advisor to their travelers and suppliers.",Software Development,11-50 employees,43,https://www.tern.travel/,1755,2000,Chief Operating Officer & Co-Founder @ Tern | Travel Technology

It’s full of free tips to play the game of life at a whole new level. In 2018 I found myself at the height of my marketing career with 3 kids under the age of 4 and filing for divorce. In a world telling me to find alignment......I realized that was impossible. The work version of me didn't want to leave early to go be with the kiddos. The mom version of me didn't want to miss a moment with them. I wanted to be fiercely independent and yet also wanted to find love again. Other versions of me didn't want to feel responsible for anything or anyone. This diversity within me led to the creation of my Character Theory Framework. This framework helped me to create space for the 10 characters that make up the movie of your life:  The CEO → wants to pursue big goalsThe Partner → desires companionship  The Soloist → cares about personal growth and development The Caregiver → deep desire to take care of others and show up for themThe Goddess → wants to be desired and pursue pleasure  The Lazy One → loves to couch rot, no goals whatsoever The Socialite → values connection The Creative → desires creation and creativity The Doctor → your inner health &amp; wellness character The Explorer → craves novelty And it helped me. I was able to let go of the idea of balance and give permission for hierarchy, boundaries and the transition sequences necessary to embody these diverse characters. So I put it all in a book and it was an instant best seller!! I'm so excited for you to create space for all parts of you and to see ambition as multi-dimensional.

We believe that everyone should have access to nootropics so they can realize their full potential.

Thesis has helped thousands of people who struggle with focus, attention, writer’s block, and countless other mental barriers that affect their brains’ performance. We tested over a hundred ingredients on thousands of people and our products produce measurable results that demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of our product.

The VPI Firm (www.thevpifirm.com),
BCIITY, Inc. (www.bciity.org), and
The EASE Cooperative (www.easedata.coop).

Below are the beliefs, commitments, and truths I stand on across all areas of work.

I'm not looking to convince, only looking to ATTRACT: Those who seek to BUILD WHAT HEALS and release what doesn't
____________________________________________

I believe that healing PEOPLE and healing SYSTEMS are one and the same.

Organizations, businesses, and institutions can (and should) serve to restore rather than deplete. I don't shy away from naming this standard, modeling it, helping to build and steward it, and acknowledging where I fall short.

Systemic transformation is a DELUSION if it still leaves people FRAGMENTED. Real transformation redeems what's been fractured WITHIN us, AMONG us, and AROUND us.

I slow down to listen before designing, I ask who is being healed or harmed by a process, and I build systems that restore BOTH those they serve AND those who sustain them.

I reject transformation that demands self-neglect.

I refuse to mask control under the guise of ""accountability"".

I refuse to glorify sacrifice and martyrdom over rest and sustainability

I resist the lie that service requires burnout to prove devotion (probably the greatest lesson I continue to unlearn).

I—and those that I get to call clients, partners, team members, and collaborators—are building LIVING, regenerative systems that give back what they request—in time, trust, energy, and results. It continues to be an iterative process rooted in being seen, valued, respected, and collectively held.

And I invite all who have searched for a more promising way to BUILD WHAT HEALS. Not through performative actions or compliance-based chokeholds; but through real lives transformed, agency restored, and hearts fulfilled.

Our ultimate reward is when our clients reflect upon the journey we have shared with them and they acknowledge the valuable advice we have provided along the way.

In short, helping you achieve your goals ultimately becomes our goals too.

HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER

Not everyone that needs independent advice has a lot of complexity. Most independent advisors attract clients that have a lot of complexity as they tend to pay higher fees. But we know that not everyone’s situation is complex. In fact, we value simplicity and we avoid ‘creating’ unnecessary complexity. Whilst we do have clients with a high degree of complexity, we can scale our advisory services to suit clients that have a relatively simple situation. Complexity is often the enemy of successful implementation.

Whilst our overarching goal is to help our clients achieve their financial and lifestyle goals, there are four key services we can draw upon at various stages of our relationship:

- Independent financial advice – our service is called Wealth Coach
- Mortgage broking and advice.
- Tax and accounting services specialising in automated accounting solutions for businesses, professionals and investors.

I'm a personal injury lawyer with a real passion is in life improvement.

The core focus of our law firm is ""To Build a Business Where People Can Thrive.""

What does this mean?

For our employees, it means that we focus on providing goal-setting advice, achievement, and coaching directed at achieving their one-year and ten-year aims.

For my clients, it means that because I've got employees who are fulfilled and have a sense of mission at the firm, my clients receive best-in-class customer service.  We pay attention to all of the little details, which is why we have over 260 five-star google reviews.

Two things happen as a result.

One, like most lawyers, all of our best cases come from referrals.  How many times have you talked to a potential new client who couldn't remember who represented them five years ago in their last case.  That doesn't happen here.  We receive more referrals from former clients and from other lawyers and medical providers because we do such a great job of the customer service/personal side of being your lawyer.

The second result is selfish.  You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  I don't want to spend time with a bunch of losers who don't have life goals outside of the office or who just go home to binge watch netflix!  I want my people to live exciting, fulfilling lives outside of the office, chasing their own big goals.

After that, we’ll gather all the relevant information—records, police reports, bills, etc.—and notify the insurance company to never contact you again. You can expect frequent follow-up calls, and can contact us any time for real, honest answers to your questions.

For long-term disability clients, we’ll review your denial letter for free. Our disability team will read every page of your claim file, conduct independent vocational analyses if the insurance company “finds” jobs you can do, and handle every aspect of your appeal. If that appeal is denied, we’ll file a lawsuit and fight for you in court.

It was during these years I became fascinated with the psychology of business and coaching—skills that have remained core to everything I’ve built since.

After graduating with honors, I was touring in a band when my car broke down. To fund the repairs, I took a job selling coupons door-to-door for a direct sales company. That detour turned into the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey.

Once ready, I opened my first business, coaching people to run their own outsourced sales and marketing firms. We acquired customers for some of the largest companies on the planet, and through relentless work, referrals, and mentorship, I expanded the business to 15 countries worldwide.

Over the years, I’ve directly trained more than 1,000 entrepreneurs—teaching them to run their companies, unlock their potential, and scale with confidence. Along the way, I’ve helped create dozens of millionaires, both through sales and later at Carbon6.

That same passion led me to co-found Carbon6, an Amazon SaaS platform built to empower marketplace sellers. We began by acquiring best-in-class point solutions and evolved into one of the most powerful platforms in the space. The company’s growth and impact ultimately led to a $210 million exit to SPS Commerce (Nasdaq: SPSC).

Along the way, I’ve become an angel investor, backing founders and products that push boundaries across e-commerce, fintech, and frontier markets. I’m currently in stealth mode with a new venture that will be announced soon—designed to solve a big, audacious problem I’ve been obsessed with for years.

As an investor, entrepreneur, international business owner, and motivational speaker, I’ve had the privilege of living and working around the world. One of the things I’m proudest of is helping raise over $5 billion for charities through face-to-face fundraising campaigns run by thousands of reps across the U.S.

It was during these years Cobb became interested in the psychology of business and coaching and these skills are something that have stuck with him throughout his career.

After graduating with honors Cobb started working alongside an entrepreneur as an intern in his direct sales company. Starting out at the very bottom Cobb did field sales throughout the North-east of America. He credits this time as giving him the life-long skills to teach and develop other individuals.

“Ask any great entrepreneur, they have all done sales at some point. You hear some people say sometimes that they aren’t sales people or that they aren’t cut out for sales. The reality is that business is sales…it is how a customer base and revenue is generated. It doesn’t matter what field you end up in, whatever the business, you’re going to have to learn to sell something whether it is a product or a service if you are going to become an entrepreneur. The skills I learned have shaped me as a business owner.”

After learning a wide range of skills working alongside business owners with much more experience, Cobb was keen to learn the ins and outs of business ownership on a more practical level. In 2004 Cobb started his first company in Charlotte, North Carolina. That company grew rapidly and in 2005 Cobb expanded his business to a further 7 cities in the southeast of America representing industry giants like the Atlanta Braves, Hilton Hotels, Papa John’s pizza and Blockbuster Video.

We deploy top-of-the-line health screenings and technology to ensure the milk that reaches our tiny babies and critically-ill kids delivers the best nutrition possible. We accept donations from moms at any stage of their breastfeeding journeys, including those who have lost the baby they so wanted.

We live by our core values - Team First, Problem Solver, Growth Mindset, Good Vibes, and Raise the Bar. We specialize in the management of single family homes, condos, and small apartment buildings.

Good Life was started by Steve Welty, a San Diego Real Estate Broker and Real Estate investor. Steve started full time in property management in 2008 when he co-owned another property management firm. He sold his share in that company and started Good Life in 2013, with the goal of providing the highest level of customer service and best customer experience in the industry. Steve realized there was a lot the customer wanted as far as services, communication, and transparency, that they were not currently getting. Steve and his team work daily to create client focused solutions to all types of property management and Real Estate related issues. Good Life has a dynamic company culture, based around growing people personally and professionally.

Good Life provides hundreds of hours of ongoing training for their staff every year. Steve recognized that if Good Life has the best trained, happiest, most passionate people, their clients and customers will ultimately be successful and tell their friends about their experience. The company is dedicated to providing a world class customer experience and raising the bar for the industry as a whole.

I’m Bucky, Co-Founder & CEO of Finni Health. We founded Finni to solve a problem we saw over and over again: providers in ABA and pediatric mental health want to focus on care, but they’re buried in operations, insurance, and systems that don’t work for them.

At Finni, we partner with providers to launch and scale their practices — handling credentialing, billing, compliance, and growth — so they can stay focused on serving families. Backed by Y Combinator and General Catalyst in both our Seed/Series A, we’ve expanded to 30+ States and tens of millions in revenue, with a best-in-class growth rate.

What drives me is proving that healthcare can scale without losing its heart . I’m passionate about building systems that expand access for kids, remove barriers for providers, and create sustainable growth models in tech-enabled healthcare services.

Outside of work, I reset through endurance training, basketball, and my strong support system of friends/family who are also trying to tackle this broken healthcare system.

I'm passionate about helping leaders and companies increase their top and bottom lines by leveraging technology and data.

CEO COACHING SUMMARY
I've coached and advised CEO's since 2009.  Similar to the best athletes and entertainers, CEO's need objective coaching and accountability as well.  I truly wish I had executive coaching earlier in my career.

In 2021, I joined the premier CEO Coaching company in the world (CEO Coaching International):
1) Every coach is a former, successful CEO, brining real life experience, success, and failures.
2) Our methodology (developed over 13+ years) is world-class.
3) The results (tangible and measured yearly) are unmistakable.  Our CEO clients' companies grow EBITDA at 3-times the industry average.

CEO Summary
I've successfully led and advised multiple companies ranging from large global corporations to entrepreneurial start-ups across a variety of industries, with a focus on leveraging technology and data to drive top and bottom-line growth.

	Most recently, as CEO of Facteus, a financial technology data company, I led the company through its largest (data analytics to 6,000 banks), most profitable growth period, transforming massive, highly-sensitive data sets into meaningful insights for investors, retailers, governments, and consultants.   Facteus received Inc. Magazine 2020 award for Fastest Growing Private Companies.  In addition, Facteus patented the innovative Synthetic Data technology, that is now the de facto standard for safely monetizing data.

	Earlier in my career, I was president of a global GE supply chain technology business unit, growing it to a 9-figure valuation, with operations in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Mideast.

	I enjoy being thought leader in the data and analytics world, having published multiple data articles, patenting Synthetic Data, and appearing on Nasdaq’s Trade Talks broadcasts.  These articles and data analyses have been the focus of media giants including WSJ, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, The New York Times, and more.

I have led technology companies in multiple industries and geographies:
- Industries: Financial Services, Financial Technology, Healthcare, Supply Chain, Government, Consulting.
- Global Experience: US, Europe, Asia, & Latin America (Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Costa Rica).

I'm passionate about helping companies increase their top and bottom lines by leveraging technology and data.

Chang began her career in entertainment as an actor and made her entryway into producing and directing through a social justice focused short film igniting conversation about bullying and suicide prevention, becoming one of the most-watched short films shining light on the epidemic through a lens of empathy. Conjointly, she developed digital toolkits distributed through one of America’s leading bullying prevention centers to bolster free resources and access for students, parents, and schools nationwide.

As an actor in popular mainstream media, Chang opened up a long overdue conversation about Asian-American representation in Hollywood. Experiencing the lack of representation throughout her decades-long career in television and film, she launched online platform 88 Cups of Tea in 2015 to amplify diverse voices, nurturing creative writers to write themselves into the heroes of their own stories. 88 Cups of Tea’s podcast arm ranked in Apple's top 15 Literature & Arts podcasts, and featured in Apple’s top 20 Asian and Pacific American voices.

Dubbed ‘NYC Empathy Broker’, Chang founded Heart of Dinner alongside life partner Moonlynn Tsai at the onset of Covid-19, a non-profit that supports small businesses while countering the isolation and food insecurity within NYC’s underserved and homebound Asian elderly communities with weekly deliveries of warm messages and culturally thoughtful meals; and doing so in intentional ways that bridge gaps and build community across all cultures and backgrounds. As of Fall 2022, Heart of Dinner has provided over 130,000 free meals.

Chang's efforts have been lauded by Time, Vogue, NBC and ABC News, Ellen, Oprah Magazine, and she was named Glamour's Woman of the Year; NYC Food Policy Center's ""40 Under 40""; and is a recipient of the Pride & Joy Award of THEM’s inaugural Now Awards 2022.",United States,"New York City Metropolitan Area, United States",Heart of Dinner 愛心餐,https://www.linkedin.com/company/heartofdinner,Heart of Dinner 愛心餐,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/60258918_company_logo,529,"31 Howard Street, #404, New York, New York 10013, US","New York, New York",2020,US,68850788,heartofdinner.org,Non Profit,heartofdinner,"Heart of Dinner reduces food insecurity, social isolation, and loneliness among Asian American older adults living in under-resourced and underinvested communities. The founders, Yin Chang & Moonlynn Tsai, united by their life partnership and mutual empathy, channeled their late-night discussions about COVID-19's global impact and the heightened racism towards Asian Americans into a proactive mission of addressing the long-standing community issues that were further exacerbated by the pandemic.

The organization's journey began in March 2020, initially involving community research and outreach. This led to their first significant milestone on April 1st, 2020, cooking culturally thoughtful hot lunches in their ~300sq. ft. NYC apartment. These meals, paired with handwritten notes in the Elders' languages, aimed to provide holistic nourishment of the body, mind, and soul.

Reacting to community needs, the founders rapidly expanded their offerings to include fresh groceries alongside meals and notes. Curating items beloved in Asian immigrant households, this enabled Elders to cook their preferred meals at home, supporting autonomy and respecting cultural dietary habits.

The handwritten notes evolved & expanded into adorning hand-illustrated brown bags, each a work of art symbolizing the love and thought in each home delivery. These bags served as visual and emotional reminders of care and connection, addressing the dual challenges of food insecurity and isolation.

With increasing support, Heart of Dinner broadened its impact across NYC, providing over 200,000 meals by Summer 2024. Transitioning from an emergency response relief effort, Heart of Dinner operated under the fiscal sponsor Edward Charles Foundation from 2020 to 2022 before it began to officially operate as a 501c3 public charity in 2023.

My practice helps ambitious leaders achieve their ideal vision for their trajectory through development of keen emotional intelligence, executive presence, their power and influence to reach remarkable results. To help people scale their roles as they scale teams, I work with them to tap into new sources of energy, find their flow, and expand their personal capacity while maintaining balance and happiness.

In order for people to execute their vision, they need power. It's a term that many shy away from because it seems controlling or ego-driven. It doesn't have to be. Power stems from sharp self-awareness, expressing your authentic self, and taking pride in both your skills and your ability to learn. As a coach, I seek to draw out and cultivate each of these areas to maximize people's power -- power to change, to do what inspires them, to get rewarded for their work.

With significant training and experience in law, neuro-linguistics and technology, I apply leading-edge coaching techniques to help clients improve their communication skills, identify how they want to accelerate their growth, and design a program tailored to their needs and goals. Running a practice based in both the Bay Area and New York City, I've worked closely with leaders at organizations like Airbnb, Facebook, Refinery29, Stanford Business School, and The New York Times.

We’re a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to revitalize capitalism and keep the American dream alive. GDP growth is slowing. Wealth inequality is increasing. Entrepreneurship is dying across America; falling from 10.6% to 3.6% among those under 30 since 1989. We’re reversing these trends by funding more deserving businesses across all of America, not solely tech startups in Silicon Valley.

This was my dream job and the only corporate job I've ever had. In fact, it's the only job *interview* I've ever had (since I interned there as a junior in college).

3. Realized working for someone else was not going to be the long-term path for me. 12 months into working on Wall Street, I saw someone in their mid-40s ask their boss for permission to go to their son's Little League game. At that moment I realized I wasn't cut out to take directions or instructions from other people for very long.

4. Started to write on my old blog, then on Twitter. Rather than quit immediately, I started to passively explore other opportunities by writing online, starting out on my old blog (which no one knew existed), then transitioning to Twitter in July of 2020.

5. Changed my trajectory with a 30-day writing challenge, which led me to start Ship 30 for 30. In September 2020 I was ready to give up writing entirely. But I gave it one more shot, this time moving from a weekly blog post to a daily Twitter thread. The challenge was a huge success. It took me 9 months to reach 100 followers and 1 month to go from 100 to 2,000. And that personal writing challenge turned into the foundation of Ship 30 for 30, which started as nothing but a Slack accountability group to help people publish consistently.

6. Scaled Ship 30 while working remotely for all of 2021. I built and scaled Ship 30 with Nicolas Cole to over 2,000 students in 2021—all while continuing to work full-time (remotely) for BlackRock. But towards the end of 2021, Ship 30 hit an inflection point and it no longer made financial sense for me to continue working on Wall Street.

7. Left BlackRock in March of 2022 to write and build on my own. After weeks of weighing the pros and cons and trying to project my path forward, I made the decision to leave BlackRock and chart my own path. 15 months into making that decision and I'm confident it's the best one I've ever made.",United States,"Miami, Florida, United States",Write With AI,https://www.linkedin.com/company/premium-ghostwriting-academy,Premium Ghostwriting Academy,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/23950622_company_logo,2782,"Miami, Florida 33137, US","Miami, Florida",2022,US,96137957,premiumghostwritingblueprint.com,Privately Held,premium-ghostwriting-academy,"Premium Ghostwriting Academy (PGA) helps freelance writers and people working full-time jobs become Premium Ghostwriters, land lucrative ghostwriting clients, start selling packaged services (like Educational Email Courses), and ultimately build a ghostwriting agency.

In today's landscape where a data breach costs companies millions, cybersecurity isn't just IT—it's business survival.

I founded Curios in 2017 with a mission to protect businesses from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, particularly for organizations that need enterprise-grade security without enterprise-level resources.

At Curios, we transform organizations into security-confident businesses through our proprietary Security Framework that ensures your cybersecurity strategy directly supports your business objectives. Unlike traditional security providers focused solely on technology, we bridge the gap between technical safeguards and business goals.

Having worked with organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to growing SMEs across Belgium and Europe, I've seen firsthand how the right security approach can become a business enabler rather than just a cost center.

My journey to founding Curios began after witnessing too many businesses devastated by preventable breaches. With over a decade in cybersecurity, I've built a team of security innovators who share my commitment to proactive protection rather than reactive damage control.

But a business can’t grow if its teams are stagnating. Growing teams and customer relationships is my passion, and being a key player in companies’ growth, both those I work for and their clients, is what motivates me.

I’ve been building account management, customer services, professional services, managed services, and customer success teams for more than 20 years. I’ve built some from the ground up, turned teams into spectacular contributors, and helped established teams scale globally. I was instrumental in increasing one company’s revenue from $8M to $20M in less than 18 months, another organization’s $55M business line to $80M and growing within a year, and in expanded another’s advertising revenue by 85-fold within six months.

I’ve helped some of my employers successfully become acquired and integrated into a larger organization. I have played an instrumental role in presenting my employer for acquisition, integrating teams post-acquisition, and evaluating other companies for acquisition.

How do I do what I do so successfully? By being an operational, strategic, process-driven, and — most importantly — collaborative and people-focused leader. People are at the heart of my success.

I spend a lot of time mentoring my team members, coaching them, communicating with them, and ensuring they understand and embody the company’s “why” and product value. I especially enjoy helping other women in tech, and I created International Women’s Day and year-long programs focused on this audience for multiple employers. Previous team members would describe me as a transparent, empathetic leader who provides meaningful feedback and brings order to chaos.

Most founders in the creative and Webflow ecosystem are talented operators who never got a roadmap — I help them build one.

This work naturally supports my role at Veza: stronger, better-run agencies become better partners and, in many cases, long-term acquisition opportunities. It’s the same mission from two angles — helping great founders unlock the next stage of growth.

I use those same systems to find business owners who are open to exploring acquisition, partnership, or exit opportunities and connect them with the right buyers when the timing is right.

At FreedomForFounders, I help founders explore their options with trust and discretion. Most of my conversations begin long before anyone is ready to sell. The focus is always on clarity first, not pressure.

My background is in outbound strategy and systems design. Through my work with ALX, I’ve helped companies build consistent deal flow by combining smart targeting, messaging, and relationship-driven outreach. That experience has evolved into working directly with founders, guiding them through valuation, buyer interest, and transition planning.

Before that, I built and scaled businesses of my own. I started in photography and videography, then helped grow The Muskoka Store from zero to over $300K in online sales within a year. Those experiences taught me how founders think and how much a business means when you’ve built it yourself.

Previously led Engineering and Data Science teams at Appdynamics. Decades of experience building Cloud Native Systems. Prior to that completed by MS in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Undergrad from IIT-Kharagpur (India).

What is Signadot?
Signadot is a Kubernetes-native ""shift left"" testing solution for Microservices. This is enabled by a unique approach to ephemeral environments (called Sandboxes) that does not duplicate infrastructure. Environment isolation is provided at the application layer vs infrastructure layer. This enables engineering teams to multiplex a large number of ""lightweight"" environments in a single physical Kubernetes cluster.

Layered on Sandboxes is an automation testing platform that can run any test including our AI assisted ""SmartTests"" that automatically compare test results between the main and branch versions. Think of his as a ""shadow testing"" approach at the Pull Request phase that gives developers quick regression feedback with minimal effort.

Using Signadot reduces infrastructure costs, distributes testing for wider coverage and boosts release velocity. This is made possible via a ""shift left"" approach to testing where you can run various functional (api contracts, integration, end-to-end etc) and non-functional (performance etc) tests at the Pull Request phase.

Feedback from our users:
- A leading FinTech company saved $2M/yr in cloud costs by eliminating duplicate testing environments using Signadot
- We eliminated > 90% of bugs from reaching staging
- Developers love the 10x faster testing cycles
- We can easily distribute testing across Engineering and not have a bottleneck on a central team

The US has 800,000+ franchise locations generating $800B, but investing in it is still complex and inefficient, despite billions of dollars changing hands each year.

Franchisors struggle as franchises are often unaffordable for those best suited to run them. This is their main limit to growth, only the wealthy can be franchisees.

FranShares introduces a platform for both retail and institutional investors to invest in franchises as part of their portfolio.

Franchise investing allows local investors to back familiar businesses, benefiting from a network effect. It is an asset class that is income producing, diversified from the stock market, a hedge against inflation, and outperform traditional investments.

My background in franchise brokerage, helping individuals find the right brand to invest in and having worked with 400+ brands gives a unique insight into the problem and ability to create the solution. My views on franchising have been featured in Forbes, Business Insider, ABC, American Express, TheHustle, Marketwatch and more with a reach of over 300 million people prior to FranShares.

FranShares has had the largest launch for an alternative investing platform and over 43,000 investors signed up for upcoming opportunities.

Imagine investing in the businesses that you go to work out at, get a haircut in, get your oil changed, and eat at. This tangibility creates a network effect because not only will you only go to those places you own a piece of, you’ll tell your friends they have to as well.

Dám vám na ni recept, jednou provždy.

Jsem klinická nutriční terapeutka, výživářka tělem i duší, CEO a odborná garantka předního konceptu nutričního poradenství MG COACHING a produktové společnosti MG Nutrition s.r.o.

Věřím, že výživa má moc měnit životy. Každý můj klient je jedinečný, ale všechny spojuje touha výživu jednou provždy vyřešit a dosáhnout tak svého plného potenciálu. Na poli nutričního poradenství mám velmi bohaté zkušenosti se širokou škálou domácí i zahraniční klientely všech věkových a výkonnostních kategorií, včetně nacházení řešení tam, kde se zdálo, že žádné “neexistuje”.

Výživové vědy jsem vystudovala na předních amerických univerzitách, počínaje bakalářským studiem nutriční terapie na University of Massachusetts v Bostonu a konče RDN titulem z klinické výživy z lékařské fakulty Florida International University v Miami. Summa cum laude, top of class.

Své specializace jsem vložila do oblasti poruch příjmu potravy a sportovní výživy. Zvolila jsem cestu nejvyšší mezinárodně uznávané dietetické licence, tj. vzdělání na lékařské fakultě s přesahem 1200+ supervizovaných rotačních hodin klinické praxe akreditovaných ACEND.

Mimo stávající akademické a klinické zázemí mám za sebou desítky akreditovaných programů, certifikací a supervizí, mimo jiné nyní například na Carolyn Costin Institute, Athlete Insight nebo Athlete EDGE. Mezi mé mentory a preceptory patřila samotná Carolyn Costin, Ron Thompson a Kate Bennett - nejuznávanější odborníci oboru.

Jsem řádnou členkou profesní asociace Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics USA (AND), Academy for Eating Disorders USA (AED), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) nebo International Association of Eating Disorders Professionals (iaedp).

Bylo mi ctí stát se jedinou českou výživářkou řady největších mezinárodních konferencí svého oboru, vč. FNCE (2022 Orlando, 2023 Denver, 2024 Minneapolis, 2025 Nashville) nebo ICED (2024 New York City, 2025 San Antonio).

Pokud se ještě nesetkáváme jako klient/pacient - nutriční, možná se slyšíme v médiích, na odborných konferencích nebo ve veřejném prostoru. Na těch mě můžete slyšet na české i mezinárodní scéně. Podle Institutu moderní výživy jsem ""nejsledovanější česká nutriční terapeutka"". Ráda totiž mluvím. O výživě dvojnásob.

Pracuji podle vědecky ověřených postupů a řídím se etickým kodexem Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession.

V profesním portfoliu mám jména od olympijských sportovců přes členy královské rodiny až po běžnou populaci.

I’m known for being a strategic, high-horsepower leader - often brought in as the first Operations hire, Integrator, or Founder right hand responsible for wearing many hats through the early stages of growth. In later stages, I am often tapped to stand up new channels, markets, or initiatives without distracting the core business.

I love small teams, brainstorming, and building meaningful things; across experience in Fortune 500 companies and startups of all sizes, it is people and purpose-led businesses that motivate me. I am equally comfortable being in-the-weeds building models and thinking big-picture about strategic goals and leading management team discussions - that ability to do both is one of my best assets.

Outside of work, I'm most likely to be exploring the outdoors with my husband and kids, planning my next scuba trip, or reading a new book.

I’ve built companies and brands from multiple vantage points — each chapter adding new skills, new perspective, and a sharper sense of what matters.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆. At Droga5, TBWA, and the Publicis Groupe, I learned and cultivated the fundamentals of creating desire and the power of radical ideas that make brands famous. Commercial creativity that didn’t just win awards, but drove business impact.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲. At Apple, I learned how to operate effectively within a system as a Creative Director. This is where I developed expertise in simplifying complexity, aligning leaders, and scaling creative systems that drove both clarity and growth. I brought those lessons into Peloton and later as Chief Brand Officer at Twill, where I helped raise a Series D, built a brand organization, led a full company rebrand, and delivered business results that ultimately led to an acquisition.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗿. I got my first taste of raw entrepreneurship as employee #3 and CCO at Spkr., an AI-audio discovery platform — and I knew company building was for me. Today I run Parlance, my studio providing fractional CBO services. I embed as a Chief Brand Operator for early-stage companies looking to become more investable, and for growth-stage and established companies that need their brand and narrative to be understood. My focus is 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗡𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 and building brands in AI, Healthtech, Robotics, Public Impact, and the Future of Work, Media, and Food.

Today, I run a company built on betting on yourself.

I still remember sitting across from my dad, explaining why I was leaving my secure corporate job to start a recruitment firm. His response?

""Too risky.""
That wasn't just a father's concern; it was a generational belief in the safety of the known path.

At the time, I was thriving at Lockton as their first-ever producer recruiter.
I had found my tribe:

Producers.
Builders. High-performers. Strivers. Connectors. Deal-makers. Risk-takers. Self-starters.
People who bet on themselves every day.

But I also saw something troubling:
Too many talented producers were making life-changing career decisions without guidance or real intel.
And recruiters treated them like transactions.

So in 2022, with no entrepreneurial background and against my family's advice, I took the leap.
Self-funded. No safety net. Just an unwavering belief that producers deserved better.

Because this isn't just about career moves.
It's about strategic decisions that shape futures, and most producers were making them without clarity, benchmarks, or the right partner in their corner.

That's why I launched Palladium Point, and later, The Producers Circle, a private newsletter community built exclusively for producers.

But I don’t do it passively.

What I do best is take traditional, often-overlooked small businesses and help them evolve — the right way:

 We operationalize calm, not chaos
 Grow profits without burning people out
 Build real teams — where people are valued, not used
 And implement 4-day workweeks that actually work

My focus is on businesses that create real local impact:
 Higher wages
 Supportive, intentional cultures
 Operations that strengthen communities — not extract from them

These companies aren’t just investments.
They’re places people are proud to work.
They’re engines of stability, dignity, and growth — and I take that seriously.

I build companies around people. When teams thrive, the business follows.

Our sensor solutions dramatically reduce these costs and uncertainties - saving operators both time and money.

 Is your wind turbine achieving the best possible performance?
 Do you want to detect problems on your turbines as early as possible?
 Would you like to know what’s happening directly on your rotor blades?

Most wind turbine operators lose their money due to unnecessary downtimes, high personal costs or damage repairs. And why? Because icing conditions, pitch angle misalignments and/or damages reduce the energy yield and lifetime of a wind turbine.

The patented and DNV certified ON-BLADE solution is mounted directly on the blade surface. With its innovative technology, the sensor system is able to reliably detect icing, measure surface temperature for preventive heating. Furthermore, it detects even the smallest rotor blade misalignment under all turbine operating conditions.

The ON-TOWER system continuously measures and analyzes changes in the sound generated by blade damage. It is attached magnetically to the base of the tower of the wind turbine at a height of approximately four meters. Through an add-on, it can detect not only blade damage but also lightning strikes through magnetic field measurements and provide data for setting appropriate measures.

The acoustic IN-BLADE system is installed at the blade access panel or within the blade depending on the preference. There it uses sound emission to detect root zone structural damage.

1. Air quality is a global killer

- 7 million deaths each year
- Millions of health-related complications
- Only 0.001% of people breathe air that meets WHO standards

2. Monitoring and improving IAQ has a solid ROI (even if IMO that should NOT matter)

- Good IAQ improves health & well-being, which increases productivity
- A small increase in employee productivity is more impactful than a 100x increase in energy savings
- But breathing clean air should be a right, not an office perk

3. Data is useless unless you know what to do with it

- You need data — lots of it, rather than an annual test — to improve IAQ
- But knowing you have 12 ug/m3 of PM2.5 gets you nowhere
- You need serious analytics beyond line charts to extract insights and get tangible outcomes (Hint: that’s what we do at Kaiterra)",United States,"San Francisco, California, United States",International WELL Building Institute (IWBI),https://www.linkedin.com/company/kaiterra,Kaiterra,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/62365321_company_logo,12952,"Crans Montana, CH",Crans Montana,,CH,5372156,kaiterra.com,Privately Held,kaiterra,"Kaiterra provides a complete air quality optimization platform leveraging hardware, software and a team of experienced professionals to help companies assess and improve their indoor air quality for better workplace experience and occupant wellbeing.

But despite checking all the right boxes, I wasn’t fulfilled.

Rather than climbing higher, I wanted to own the ladder. I had worked with high-performing teams, but I always felt disconnected—from the mission, from leadership, and from my ability to truly influence outcomes.

I craved something bigger. My colleagues were content with slow promotions, but I wanted control. I wanted ownership.

From the outside, everything looked great—steady paychecks, career growth, a strong resume. But behind the scenes, I knew I was just another cog in the machine. I was tired of building someone else’s dream.

Then came the breaking point.

My wife suffered a miscarriage. The next day, I was sent across the country for a board meeting. Sitting in that room, pretending business as usual, I had a moment of clarity: I couldn’t do this anymore.

When I got home, I quit. No backup plan. No safety net. Just a gut feeling that there had to be a better way.

I surrounded myself with real entrepreneurs—people who built businesses from the ground up. Unlike in business school, where we learned theory, these people took action and created opportunities.

Then, I heard a Tony Robbins podcast where someone was asked, ""What’s your favorite piece of technology?""

His answer? Cryotherapy.

That one word sent me down an unexpected path.

Six months later, I signed my first franchise lease. Over the next six years, I opened 15+ locations, testing different strategies, financing models, and operations. I learned firsthand what scaling a business really takes.

 I won awards.
 I helped close 200+ franchise sales.
 I found my passion—helping others do the same.

Now, I work with:
 Entrepreneurs looking to buy, launch, or scale a business.
 Franchise brands wanting to accelerate growth and attract the right franchisees.
 Investors seeking smart, scalable opportunities in franchising.

If you’re ready to build, buy, or scale a business, let’s connect.

Most importantly, I’m a dad of two wonderful kids and very happily married to Jen.

I started Mizzen+Main from an idea to use advanced performance fabrics in traditional dress shirts. We were laughed at by all the industry experts who told us no one would ever wear that. Today, Mizzen+Main has done hundreds of millions in revenue, is stocked in a dozen stores and 1,000 partner locations, and is well known for its incredible products that transformed an industry. Our endorsements with JJ Watt & Phil Mickelson are legendary.

I took everything I learned from Mizzen+Main with the goal to help parents and kids get more sleep based on my own experience. Yet again, industry experts told us we were crazy. Yet again, they were wrong.

Shortly after my son was born, the leading “baby monitor” on the market (Nanit) failed our family. I’ve wanted to fix this problem for years. Harbor is a camera and dedicated 10"" tablet that connect directly to each other without internet while both devices also connect to the cloud, giving parents remote access via our app along with record and rewind functionality. All parents' memories are stored on the camera locally and all AI processing is done at the edge on device, meaning unlike Nanit, Owlet or other WiFi cameras, we don't process or store ANY of our customers' data.

The opportunity to help parents has become even greater. Our revolutionary baby monitor has enabled Harbor to create a Remote Night Nanny bringing 95% of the benefit of an in-home night nanny for just 5% of the cost. We’re democratizing sleep expertise and changing lives.

Harbor’s mission is happier parents and healthier families, one restful night a time.

Professionally, my life’s work is to build ground breaking products that improve people’s lives, create value for our investors and teams, and change perception of what’s possible.

There is a sentence you never expect to hear directed at you. After the initial shock subsided a bit, I decided that I wasn't going to let that keep me from living a full and amazing life...and here I am.

After 4 years flying all over the U.S. defending auto manufacturers in product liability cases, I decided I knew enough to go start a plaintiff personal injury firm. So, another guy and myself quite our good-paying jobs in 2008 (the worst economy I had ever seen) and decided to hang our shingle.

We found out that there was, in fact, a lot we did not know, but we managed to learn and create a successful firm anyway. Then the time came for us to go our separate ways.

On September 1, 2017, I founded Snellings Law in Frisco, Texas. Two months later, on October 31, 2017, I was rolled back to the operating room right after my best friend, and I received his kidney. It was pretty surreal not just to be getting a kidney transplant, but to have it done on Halloween morning.

As we have grown the firm, I have found a passion for business and running/growing a law firm. I have had a tremendous amount of support, and I love supporting others. I post a lot of content about running a law firm, including what I do that works and doesn't work.

Entrepreneur. Investor. Advocate for shifting humanity’s perspective from disease management to proactive health optimization.

I'm Boomer Anderson, CEO of Smarter Not Harder (SNH) and deeply passionate about redefining how we approach health. I believe we've collectively taken health for granted far too long, only reacting once it's compromised. My mission—and the ethos behind everything I do—is to catalyze a global shift: from treating diseases to optimizing health proactively.

At the heart of this movement is our nonprofit, Health Optimization Medicine and Practice (HOMeHOPe). Here, we train doctors and healthcare practitioners to prioritize health over illness. Our core analytical module, Metabolomics, equips clinicians with tools to understand health at its biochemical core. Upon mastering Metabolomics, practitioners advance through a rigorous curriculum covering Chronobiology, Exposomics, Bioenergetics, Evolutionary Medicine, Epigenetics, and the Gut-Immune System, emerging as certified pioneers in the health optimization field.

Smarter Not Harder isn't just a name—it's a promise. Under its umbrella is Troscriptions, a disruptive nutraceutical brand that's as obsessed with quality and effectiveness as entrepreneurs are with growth. Our goal isn't simply to move products; it's to revolutionize personal health practices through novel ingredients and groundbreaking delivery methods. Sure, profits matter—but our primary currency is impact. And that impact has captured attention worldwide, placing Troscriptions in global media spotlights.

My side obsession? The health of entrepreneurs themselves. Entrepreneurship often falls prey to survivorship bias; we celebrate successes while ignoring the toll this path takes. I work individually with driven entrepreneurs, helping them optimize their health so they can sustainably pursue their visions—and change the world while they're at it.

After living overseas for 13 years, I now proudly call Chicago home. I'm deeply entrenched in its vibrant culture and passionately loyal to its sports scene (for better or worse—mostly worse these days).

But significant measurement challenges have held soil carbon back - until now.

 YOUR JOURNEY as a leader and growth engine is the #1 key to unlocking the full potential of your law firm. We can easily increase revenues while you live a better life by following the 7 Stages of Law Firm Leadership, my coaching road map developed specifically for law firms.

With 13+ years working in, for, with, and on exclusively law firms, I have seen it all.

Better yet, I saw the PATTERNS...

There are consistent challenges faced by growing law firms, from marketing to hiring to leading a growth-oriented team. These challenges evolve as the firm evolves, which is why we work with the 7 Stages of Law Firm Leadership. By focusing on change we can control (how you operate as the owner), we affect change through the whole organization!

The real secret...

is NOT a marketing strategy... or management system... or goal-setting... or any one thing.

It's understanding the WHOLE BUSINESS and getting it to work in concert!

Together, we will scale your firm and produce a transformation you may see as ""impossible"" today. Soon, it will be your reality!

Hi there, my name is Stephan.

To date, the stories we've created with our clients have...
 won an EMMY Award (for our documentary work with a Hawaii Tour Boat operator),
 brought their content to Broadcast television,
 have helped non-profit organizations break through their fundraising goals by 250%,
have worked with prestigious national brands.

Today my team and I help ethical brands with soul create wonderful stories that rise above the noise & engage in profitable communications through the craft of storytelling.

Before that I worked in business consulting for local Hawaii brands translating business needs with tech solutions, film production on feature films, hospitality management at Four Seasons Resorts and Hotels, web development and PR for an Olympic Gold medalist skier and a brief stint in book publishing.

That was all started through my educational background at a German Foreign School in New York, as well as a bachelor or arts degree at Columbia College in the City of New York.

My offer to you?

We embark on a storytelling adventure. Together. I will listen to your wants, needs, desires, goals, opportunities, challenges, vision, etc... and will respect your time and business. I expect that you will be fully present in our endeavor together and respect our time and expertise as well.

Our time together isn't a magic pill you can take in which I do everything for you. No.

Our time together will be magical, because of what happens when we engage in the creative process to uncover your or your brand's one-of-a-kind stories, your differentiating factors and USP. No one else has those and that's how we authentically cut through the noise and find separation from the competition.

I've spent tens of thousands of hours interviewing, story-finding, and organizing massive amounts of data points into story structure designed to move an audience.
I've touched every aspect of filmmaking on feature film sets, indie sets, and corporate brand short films.

After some early business learnings, I volunteered in Guatemala + Canada for a year and then studied at the University of Waterloo. During this time I managed a team of 20+ sales reps for a travel startup and founded an events company that brought thousands of people to events across Canada.

I then joined SendGrid to help companies like Uber, Spotify, and Airbnb send their most critical communications. I rode the rollercoaster of startup -> IPO -> $3B+ acquisition by Twilio.

Cubby Beds is my life mission, inspired by a childhood friend with special needs. We manufacture and deliver smart sensory beds to improve sleep and safety for people with cognitive conditions like Autism, Epilepsy, and Dementia. We have shipped thousands of beds to all 50 states, have over 1,000 5 star reviews, and partnered with Joyance Venture Capital, Arc Capital, Stanford & LA Children's Hospital.

--- Previously --
Prior to starting Nguyen Coffee Supply, I had an extensive career as an award-winning writer, filmmaker, director, and journalist committed to producing uplifting and empowering content for the world. Beats included racial justice, immigration, women's empowerment, activism, and the Asian American community.

My documentary created for NBC News titled ""Deported,"" follows the grassroots fight to end deportation of Cambodian Americans from the U.S. to Cambodia. I led a crew to film in four U.S. cities and abroad in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, capturing a historical meeting between activists, deportees, and the Cambodian government in a discussion to revise the Repatriation Agreement between the two countries and end deportation.

“Deported” won the 2018 NAMIC Vision Award for Best Digital Media, Long Form (The National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications).

My documentary series for NBC News, “Self-Starters,” celebrates Asian American trailblazers around the country. “Self-Starters” was the first series to launched the video platform for NBC Asian America and was nominated for the LA Press Club and EPPY Awards alongside TIME, CNN, and ESPN.

Nguyen Coffee Supply was founded by Sahra Nguyen, a first generation Vietnamese American and a quintessential Millennial of the “Slash Generation.” Her multifaceted creative career includes award-winning documentary filmmaker behind NBC News’ “Deported,” co-founder of New York Times reviewed restaurant “Lucy’s Vietnamese Kitchen,” co-founder of podcasting agency “Listening Party,” and a 2018 Google Next Gen Tech Policy Leader. Nguyen is the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, who fled their country by boat after the Vietnam War, and eventually settled in Boston, MA, where she was born and raised.

There are many factors to focus on: funding, how the plans are designed, inclusivity, and compliance, to name a few.

Each growth stage brings new challenges and priorities in each category.

The complexity is stifling for many HR and Financial executives that are traditionally understaffed and overworked.

The goal is to build a comprehensive employee benefits program that meets their employees' needs while being budget-friendly.

Getting there is the challenge.

That is where I come in.

I primarily help companies in four different areas:

1. Optimizing the Benefits Experience for HR and employees by reducing the administrative burdens for HR and creating an intuitive holistic benefits platform for employees.

2. Transitioning companies from fully insured to self-funded. For companies already self-funded, I reverse language within the self-funded vendor contracts to favor my clients rather than further line the pockets of the benefit providers.

3. Leading successful and smooth PEO extractions by breaking down the transition into four project tracks: HR Processes & Systems, Employee Benefits, Business Insurance, and Retirement. Each track has a change management plan and project leader.

4. Building and managing Health & Welfare Benefit programs for PEOs, including creating and launching Health & Welfare Benefit programs for virgin PEOs.

In all four cases, I develop a multi-year benefits strategy that increases the employee experience and wellbeing. As a result, I produce significant savings and eliminate wasted costs within the healthcare system that cost companies millions over the years.

If your company is in the startup phase, experiencing growth, or getting ready to go public, I am happy to discuss what employee benefits options make the most sense, not just for where you are currently but where you ultimately want to be.

Since we founded the company in January 2013 and for about seven years, that was my focus. Today the business is a >400 people company, with ~$200m in revenue and offices in several countries. We raised >$200m from Insight & Goldman, and done >$100m of liquidity cumulatively (not just for us founders). Learned some things through the journey. Still on the board. Stepped off as an employee end of 2019.

I started investing and supporting other entrepreneurs around 2018. Ro Health (5B), Frame.io (Sold to Adobe recently @ 1.3b) & Forter (3B) have been my main private investments. I do very few things. In 2018-2020 I have deployed >$90m into nine companies - primarily into B-pre IPO rounds, and always alongside institutional venture/growth equity firms, acting flexibly as either lead or meaningful co-investor. Good companies often want branded rounds. It is fulfilling to help craft those, when you've done a lot of them yourself and understand what it's like on the fundraising side.

In 2019 I led my first $50m Series C round, into Frame.io, and joined the board on behalf of Insight. If we talk about my investing in your company with Insight I'll provide full details on how that works.

In 2020 I led Homesome's $6.7m Series A with several Unicorn execs/founders, and Forter's $120m Series E on a TS I issued, with Bessemer and Felix joining.

I enjoy working alongside founder CEOs and look to do few, concentrated, big things that allow me to spend a lot of time with a small group. Yes, this isn't a normal set up. Normal doesn't achieve outlier results.

Ask the VC selling you if they've ever actually made >$10m as a founder. Or if they have an audited IRR >100%. Better yet, ask them how they earned the right to deploy capital in the first place - If it's not a grueling story, something is off - they had it too easy ;-)",United States,"New York City Metropolitan Area, United States","GCash (Mynt - Globe Fintech Innovations, Inc.)",https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearegcash,GCash,https://d878vporrm2hj.cloudfront.net/company/43350569_company_logo,256635,"W Global Center, 9th Ave. cor. 30th St., Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila 1630, PH","Taguig, Metro Manila",2015,PH,14693558,gcash.com,Privately Held,wearegcash,"Mynt is the first and only duacorn in the Philippines.

I’ve thrived on bringing people together since early childhood. When I was in junior kindergarten, I remember nervously walking into class on my first day of school and seeing all the unfamiliar faces. To calm my nerves, I started building a spaceship with some large blocks. Eventually, another curious kid joined in and soon the entire class was working on it. Our teacher even took a photo of us in front of the finished product, and it hung on the school’s wall for years after. That experience sparked my passion for organizing people and working collaboratively, which has stayed with me throughout my life.

As children, we learn the importance of teamwork and play before we even learn to read and write. It's an essential aspect of our humanity and necessary for tackling the difficult challenges we face, such as climate change and pandemics. No single profession or country can solve these issues alone. We need to unite and work together to overcome them.

In 2016, I founded Makers, which is a first-of-its-kind collective of producers from different sectors of the business and entertainment world. As of September 2022, Makers has brought together 11,000+ producers from 170+ countries. Our goal is to tackle projects that seem impossible, using collaboration and unconventional thinking. We build customized teams for each partnership, and we commit to the highest level of craftsmanship. Our producers serve as our client’s direct partner, execution superpower, and carry zero bias, so they always have your best interests in mind.Together, we have worked with global clients such as Canada Goose, RBC, Credit Karma, PepsiCo, Sephora, Amazon, and Habitat for Humanity,  and many more.

I want people to associate the title of Producer with someone who creates an environment where deep knowledge experts are motivated to work together.

They don’t leverage email properly.

(Even though email has been proven to lower customer acquisition costs by >20%.)

If you’re like most businesses I’ve worked with, you’ve probably tried:
 Getting overwhelmed by doing it yourself or working with freelancers
 Hiring email “experts” who command $100K salaries + benefits but fail to get results
 Dumping money into Facebook and other channels while your prime audience sits stagnant

In the end, even though most company leaders know the value of email, they struggle to capitalize on their existing list…

Whether their revenue is $500K or $30M.

So I started an agency focused on retention marketing to solve this problem.

At BMO Media, every one of our senior consultants has a proven track record of massive success with retention email marketing for D2C brands.

We don’t passively manage your email list. We help our clients:

 Increase customer retention and LTV
 Grow a database of *healthy* subscribers primed to buy
 Get a better return on $$$ spent in other marketing channels
 Lower customer acquisition costs through email/SMS nurturing

We’ll manage your email strategy, copy, design, coding, and implementation…

…all for less than half the price of ONE full-time email specialist.

We’ve generated more than $200 million for clients (including Liquid Death, Dr. Squatch, Our Place, etc) since 2021…

And increased our clients email/SMS revenue by 78% on average.

Yet mental health defines the quality of our lives. We know that mental health is closely intertwined with physical health, and it’s not yet clear the extent to which mental health drives physical disease, or how improving mental state can improve physical health. This area holds real promise for unlocking human potential in terms of satisfaction, fulfillment, and physical functioning.

As a Postdoctoral Fellow in Genetics working with Dr. Michael Snyder, Chair of Genetics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford, my work applies Precision Health techniques for understanding and improving human mental health. In particular, focusing on positive non-pharmaceutical approaches to thriving and awareness programs. I am particularly interested in these approaches that gave me back my own ability to be present and grateful.

My research aims to identify more effective strategies to improve depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being, as well as so understand whether the mind body connection can be leveraged to prevent and overcome disease. This shift in our understanding of the mind as a fundamental part of physical health comes at a critical time, as the World Health Organization predicts that mental health will be the leading cause of disease by 2030.

I have a PhD in Molecular Nutrition with a focus on Precision Nutrition, Chemistry, and Biochemistry from Cornell University. I'm excited about personalized approaches to nutrition, wellness, and personal growth, including challenging the way that people (including myself) see the world and bringing more kindness and compassion to the way we relate to ourselves and others. Today the wellness industry is largely separate from clinical medicine, however, they are growing closer together every day.

My purpose is to show up with love, kindness, and service for the people around me. My mission is to integrate wellness-based approaches to mental health and thriving into clinical treatment paradigms.

In my extensive career as a senior executive and as a management consultant I always saw myself as the Chief People Officer and not the Chief Human Resource Officer.

This is an important distinction because it shapes the way we see the people we work with.

I’m a veteran of five IPO’s and have intimate experience with the opportunities and challenges that come when organizations go through significant transformation.

I use a term called Corporate Courage that identifies when a company or organization is able to put their people first, even in the midst of organizational disruption. It isn’t easy, but in my career working with some of the finest companies in the world, I’ve discovered that when an organization puts their people first, they are able to weather the challenges and emerge stronger than before because of the strength of their people.

I believe in humor and live by the philosophy that if I can see the punchline, I will see the solution;  and thus I default to comedy as the first approach in most situations.

Sometimes, based upon my experience or my sense of humor, I am asked to speak to groups of people about a variety topics such as:  the future of work; the future of human resources, organizational dislocation; corporate courage; humor in the workplace; innovation and social consciousness in business.

I spend my time away from work trying to give back a bit and have participated in the Board of Regents at Holy Names College and Board of Advisors to the Cameron School of Business at UNCW.

One of the great joys of my life has been recognition for my contributions as a recipient of the 2023 HROToday CHRO of the Year for Innovation, named as one of the 2021 Top 100 HR Tech Influencers by HR Executive, received the 2014 ""Stevie Award"" for Women in High Tech, and named by the Silicon Valley Business Journal in 2015 as one of the ""100 Women of Influence"" in Silicon Valley.

Always curious,"" and ""Obsessed with Impact."" These are my core convictions, and I weave them into everything I do.

I believe that mortgage professionals are on the frontline of the financial literacy battle in America, so I founded Mortgage Coach to help lenders provide the best financial advice to borrowers. As of today, millions of borrowers receive a Mortgage Coach experience powered by tens of thousands of loan officers annually.  As Chief Growth Officer of TrustEngine–the industry's first borrower intelligence platform–my mission has evolved. I'm passionate about educating and empowering data-driven mortgage professionals to become lifelong champions for their customers. I've conducted over 1,000 interviews with top industry leaders, leveraging YouTube as a sales training platform and making the Mortgage Coach YouTube channel a ""Netflix"" for loan officers and mortgage executives.

I've been married to my amazing wife, Kelly, for 32 years, and we're the proud parents of Jack and Syd. I'm also a co-founder of FirstHome IQ, a nonprofit dedicated to solving the financial literacy gap for Gen Z and first-time home buyers who want to buy their first home.

I believe in a few basic tenets:

1. Technology isn't going to replace loan officers. But loan officers who master technology will replace loan officers who don't.
2. Sell the problem you solve, not the product you make.
3. Have fun and play loose.

If anything I've shared resonates with you, I'd love the opportunity to speak with you.

As an early-stage venture capital firm, our fintech, enterprise, and consumer investments have reinvented industries and defined new markets. For over a quarter of a century—through boom and bust, prosperity or calamity—Foundation Capital has endured, evolved, and thrived, with over $3B assets under management, 34 IPOs and ICOs, and 80+ acquisitions to our name. Building companies is in our bones.

We back individuals who want to nudge the world ahead in some way, using a transformative business as their fulcrum. Great companies, like Apple or Amazon or Netflix, aren’t formed from code and corporate charters. They’re built on a foundation of dreams and desires; raised up through struggle and sacrifice. For such companies to succeed, the people who start and lead them have to want success badly. It has to come from the deepest part of them—a hunger to create something consequential, something lasting; a need to prove themselves, whether out of a sense of mission, or a yearning for significance, or a heart full for disobedience. We look for people who believe—even if they would never speak it out loud—that the purpose of life is to be briefly extraordinary.

We think that since the beginning of invention, humanity has advanced because the remarkable have pushed us forward. Because select women and men of their times have dared to think different, to build it better, to do what’s never been done. Across the ages, we’ve had many names for these people.

As Principal of the All Things Facades Group, I work at the intersection of business development and technical execution — representing leading façade manufacturers and advising project teams across the following:

- Windows - existing buildings & new construction
- Unitized - window wall, curtain wall, bypass
- Architectural Glass - high performance, oversized, curved, laminated, thin triple/quad assemblies
- Metal - louvers, sunshades, screens, decorative/ornamental

My role blends independent manufacturer representation with hands-on advisory support for developers, architects, contractors, glaziers, and consultants. Whether it’s early-stage concept, specification support, or project delivery, I help teams win better work, avoid costly mistakes, and build façades that perform.

Alongside project work, I run the All Things Facades educational platform, where I share daily insights, annotated field details, and podcast conversations with industry leaders.

My mission is to raise the bar for façade education and create a trusted hub for professionals across the building envelope world.

If you’re looking to:
• Advance a project with technical advisory
• Explore manufacturer representation
• Collaborate on education or brand positioning
• Or simply exchange ideas on façade systems

What we do:
- Manufacturer representation (independent sales rep)
- Strategic advisory for developers, architects, contractors, and manufacturers
- Technical consulting (specs, details, peer review, value engineering)
- Go-to-market & brand positioning for façade products
- Education & outreach
- Voice-of-customer & product-market fit feedback loops

With experience across curtain wall, window wall, unitized systems, specialty glazing, and custom assemblies, we bridge the gap between design intent and constructible, durable solutions.

Goal: help partners win better projects and deliver high-performance façades that last—through a mix of representation, technical consulting, strategic advisory, and industry education.

Building companies is in our bones.

We back individuals who want to nudge the world ahead in some way, using a transformative business as their fulcrum. Great companies, like Apple or Amazon or Netflix, aren’t formed from code and corporate charters. They’re built on a foundation of dreams and desires; raised up through struggle and sacrifice. For such companies to succeed, the people who start and lead them have to want success badly. It has to come from the deepest part of them—a hunger to create something consequential, something lasting; a need to prove themselves, whether out of a sense of mission, or a yearning for significance, or a heart full for disobedience. We look for people who believe—even if they would never speak it out loud—that the purpose of life is to be briefly extraordinary.

We think that since the beginning of invention, humanity has advanced because the remarkable have pushed us forward. Because select women and men of their times have dared to think different, to build it better, to do what’s never been done. Across the ages, we’ve had many names for these people.

My family’s story has also shaped the lens through which I see the world and understand my role in it. I was born in Pereira, Colombia – where I lived until my family immigrated to the U.S. in 1999, fleeing decades of internal civil war, social unrest, and economic inequality.

With only an elementary school education, my parents found work in construction, housekeeping, and custodian services. We fought a decade-long immigration adjustment process during which we experienced life as undocumented immigrants. Through a mix of luck, perseverance, hard work, and support from many generous individuals along the way – the course of my life and that of my family drastically changed for the better.

I attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, began my finance career at Goldman Sachs with the support of incredible mentors, and expanded my awareness of the business world's ability to deliver profit with purpose at Harvard Business School – all unlikely outcomes for someone of my background.

HOW I LEAD
I’ve built a reputation for leading with vision, authenticity and an intrinsic commitment to making things better. Whether it’s transforming workplace culture, designing high-impact programs, or building high-performing and high-thriving teams, I bring energy, clarity and a results-driven mindset to everything I do.

Oh, and I like to make sure we have a lot of *fun* while doing it!

WHAT DRIVES ME
Purpose-Driven Leadership: I don’t believe in doing things just because “that’s how they’ve always been done.” I challenge the status quo to create strategies that actually work - for people and for business.
Authenticity & Connection: People work best when they feel seen, heard and empowered. I build high-trust environments where people bring their full & best selves to the table.
Bold, Impactful Execution: I love to GSD, but it's more than that. It's about moving with intention, cutting through inefficiency and delivering results that matter on a large scale. It's combining vision with rigor so ideas become something tangible: measurable and high-value outcomes.

In 2018, Cape Town was forced to severely ration water use to 50 liters per day as city's water supply was projected to run dry — that’s over 4.8 million people.

Today, Mexico City is facing water shortages due to over-extraction of groundwater and the population growth — that’s over 22 million people.

Notice a trend?

Every year, more and more people, in 10s of millions, are being affected by extreme weather, climate change, and increasing demand.

How do you fix this problem?

The options so far have been:

 Delivering water in trucks

 Building mass-scale desalination plants

 Digging newer deeper wells as existing ones are drying

What would actually be a good solution is something that’s:

- Easy to install
- Fast to deploy
- Affordable

The truth is that most homeowners and businesses do agree that water security is an increasing issue and needs solving.

But unfortunately the existing solutions are neither sustainable nor good for the environment:

 Digging wells is uncertain, prohibitively expensive or not allowed

 Trucking water in is becoming more expensive and unsustainable

 Municipal restrictions are increasing and what used to work no longer works

 Availability of clean water supply has more recently decreased due to drought, contamination or other effects of climate change.

For years, I’ve seen communities struggling with these problems.

Until my brother, Eric, and I decided to partner up and start Aquaria.

In simple terms, we pull clean water out of the air with our Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG) tech.

We’re on a mission to serve up to 1 million people in the most affected areas in the next decade.

And we’ve already worked with a wide variety of homeowners, commercial companies, and developers.

We’ve also set up The Aquaria Frontier Access Program — our in-house social program to provide subsidized atmospheric water generators to communities in need. As a Public Benefit Corporation, we actively seek to partner with:

- Water-related NGOs, charitable groups
- Community project developers
- Social & sustainable development groups
- Communities and projects to deploy

My mission is to change that.

I’m the Founder & CEO of Zero Gravity, a tech startup that unlocks potential by powering students from low-opportunity areas into uni, work, and life.

Here’s my journey so far:

 I grew up in a single-parent family in a small town in West Yorkshire. I made the journey from state schools to Oxford University, and saw first-hand just how high the barriers are for students like me to break into elite institutions.

 Oxford introduced me to a new world of possibilities I never knew existed. I realised that whilst talent is everywhere, opportunity is not. So when I graduated, I turned down my corporate job offers and set out to level the playing field.

 I launched Zero Gravity from my bedroom with the last £200 of my student loan. The platform identifies talented students from low-opportunity areas and powers them into top universities and careers.

 And the platform really works! Zero Gravity has supported 15,000+ students into top universities, and our members’ stories have been featured in BBC News, Channel 4, Sky News, and The Times, amongst others.

 Zero Gravity has deployed £2.3m of scholarships to low-income students to make university affordable to all. Zero Gravity now manages one of the UK’s largest scholarship funds for low-income students.

 But going to university is just the beginning. We’ve now partnered with leading employers such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, KPMG, Snapchat, and Rolls Royce to power thousands of students into elite careers through our platform.

 Zero Gravity has picked up over 40 awards, and I've somehow managed to snag a bit of the limelight myself. I've ended up on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, bagged a social impact award from the Prime Minister, and even been honoured with a British Empire Medal by King Charles.

 I’ve raised £6.5m from Europe’s leading tech investors to build a talented team of 25 individuals based out of Zero Gravity HQ in Central London. We're all working hard to create a world where talent matches opportunity.

——

It’s been an incredible ride so far, but I know this is just the beginning!

So as I start my next chapter, I’ll be sharing behind-the-scenes access to my journey building Zero Gravity and the lessons I learn along the way.

Since 2019, we’ve built the UK’s leading tech platform for social mobility. Zero Gravity is packed with features designed to take talent to the top - from mentoring, masterclasses, scholarships, to exclusive internship and job opportunities.

Here’s the impact so far:

 We’ve supported 8,000+ students to secure spots at top universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and the Russell Group.
 We’ve deployed £1.8 million in scholarships to low-income students, ensuring finances don’t stand in the way of ambition.
 Through partnerships with leading employers (think HSBC, KPMG, Morgan Stanley, and Jaguar Land Rover) we’re propelling students into elite careers, building pathways to lasting success.

We don’t want to sound too grand; but we believe that Zero Gravity isn’t just a platform - it’s a movement. We’re reimagining a world where no student’s future is limited by their postcode, school, or bank balance.

Especially after raising $10M from top VCs, building a coveted brand, and being featured in dream publications like The New York Times and Tim Ferriss' book Tools of Titans.

But after nearly 10 years in Silicon Valley, I was completely burnt out. I made all the classic mistakes: imposter syndrome, trying to do everything myself, not asking for help. I wrecked my health, my happiness, and the results I was achieving as a founder and CEO.

The surprising thing that got me though the tough times - and helped me turn everything around - was hiring a CEO coach. I was skeptical at first, but working with a coach changed my life and my career.

After crawling my way out of burn out, I had the honor of advising and coaching start-ups that in just 5 years grew from Seed stage to $3B in total valuations. I became a Venture Partner at a VC fund aligned with my values. And most importantly, I learned to enjoy the ride.

Today, I coach a select group of founders that are ambitious, ethical, and have a voracious appetite to improve themselves. We typically start after Series A funding and our goal is to take it all they way to IPO or acquisition.

When I'm not coaching founders, you can find me snowboarding, mountain biking, or having the time of my life with my wife and two young children.

Achieve fulfillment.
- Discover your values. You are what you value.
- Uncover your life purpose. Why were you placed on this earth?
- Coax and nourish your inner leader.

View your circumstances from other perspectives.
- Realize that your truth is not the truth.
- Learn to separate facts from your interpretation of those facts.

Discover the depths of your emotional self.
- People don't like feeling sad, disappointed, frustrated, angry; so they usually do everything they can to avoid them. But through coaching, it's important to resolve those feelings and understand that your ability to process your lowest moments enables you to experience your highest joys.

But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is from the past century and broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

We're changing that. AtoB is modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs reliably, instantly and fairly.

However, I also noticed that most enterprises were still relying on low-tech processes that were holding their frontline workers back.

This realization led me to co-found Datch, an innovative AI company whose mission is to radically simplify frontline work for industrial enterprises worldwide.

My journey began in Australia as an aerospace engineer and later took me to the UK, where I worked across the entire manufacturing process - from engineering design, testing, validating, to working with customers through deployment.

It was during this time that I noticed how much time frontline workers were spending on repetitive work management tasks like completing work orders, capturing safety information, and carrying out procedures. This was holding them back and bleeding away their productivity, without them even realizing it.

To unlock the true potential of an organization's data, frontline workers needed a solution that could guide them intuitively and converse with them.

As a builder obsessed with applying tech to real-world needs, I saw this as a chance to bring AI into the familiar but often overlooked world of the industrial frontline.

So I grabbed my friend (and by then, co-founder) Ben Purcell by the collar, and spent a month traveling all over the UK and Ireland to investigate. We spoke to countless frontline managers to understand the struggles industrial enterprises faced in their daily work. This is when we discovered the ""input problem"" - that countless hours were spent interacting with important legacy systems and eating up valuable time.

Today, Datch enables customers across various industries, including manufacturing, energy & utility, and mining, to make faster and better decisions with intelligent insights.

By simplifying their work and making it more intuitive, we boost efficiency for our customers while increasing the quality of knowledge gathered from the frontline.

When I am not thinking all things Datch or technology, you’ll find me writing music, playing my guitar, and experimenting with all kinds of genres - from blues to EDM.

In order to support the asset availability goals across resource management, reporting, planning, scheduling, and reliability, the product is designed around a single value proposition: ”perfect data”. By perfect data, we mean complete, highly accurate, context rich reports coming in from the frontline, and perfect recall and distillation of data to the right people at the right time.

Where many see barriers, I see opportunities. This led me to begin my career in Shanghai and its real estate market. Through determination and an immersive approach to understanding Chinese culture and business—including learning Mandarin thanks to friendly Shanghai taxi drivers—I pioneered several groundbreaking projects and founded China's first carbon-neutral hotel brand, URBN Hotels and Resorts.

Today, I bring this global perspective with local insight to Los Angeles as co-founder of Relevant Partners. My approach combines disciplined thinking with creative freedom, always seeking undersupplied markets and asking not just “What's missing?” but “What's possible?” This philosophy has served me well across Southeastern Asia and now California.

In real estate development, I've learned that true luxury isn't about lavish amenities—it's about creating spaces that foster connection and enrich lives.

Our latest project, The Ranch at Coachella Valley, embodies this vision perfectly. Just two hours from Southern California and neighboring the iconic Coachella Music Festival grounds, it exemplifies what community can become when we blur the lines between home and hospitality. Modern housing should do more than provide shelter—it should create communities that enrich lives, where luxury and community coexist harmoniously.

As an active member of the Entrepreneurs' Organization since 2002, including serving as Shanghai Chapter President in 2015, I've experienced firsthand how powerful community and knowledge sharing can be. I'm focused on bringing hospitality DNA to traditional real estate, transforming spaces into experiences that inspire connection.

As a classically-trained and practiced architect, Marie unlocks a different level of depth in her designs through her mutual consideration of interior and structure; her homes and commercial projects reveal the magic that transpires when each is made to augment the other. This spirit of cooperation permeates our firm entirely, and we are involved early and often in conversations with our clients, architects, builders, and vendors, ranging from the theoretical to the deeply technical.

Architectural drawings double as blueprints for our own process, the compass by which we begin to precisely map and envision each aspect of a space. For us this is as integral to the conception of an interior as it is to the immense coordination and procurement that follows. As we thoughtfully marry the myriad elements of structure and style––composition and color; lighting and fixtures; fabrics; furnishings; finishes; collected and custom pieces––organization is critical to guiding and tracking the thousands of decisions involved in bringing a home or commercial space to life.

I'm the guy who's spent 20 years saying the world needs startup countries to get innovation & customer-focus in the governance industry. After all, innovation requires trying new things, which is almost impossible in governance. And monopoly providers like today's countries have little incentive to serve their customer-citizens well. That's why startup cities, territories, and eventually countries are the answer.

In the early 2000s I created this theory, and looked to ocean cities as the answer, writing a book on seasteading and then (with funding from Peter Thiel) starting the non-profit Seasteading Institute in 2008. When the Honduran ZEDE program started in 2011, I pivoted to charter cities on land, as it seemed much more tractable. I started the first modern co in the space, Future Cities Development, and then in 2017 began developing the first investment fund for the space, Pronomos Capital.

Other work I'm proud of includes starting intentional communities in 2000 & 2005, coding for 10 years at Google (from 2004), writing the first breakeven AI poker bot (2005, w/ Adam Bliss & Mike Maurer), founding the Ephemerisle festival (15y: 2009-present), and proposing a decentralized network of open-source nodes validating cryptocurrency transactions by majority vote in 2002 in a paper read by absolutely no one.
