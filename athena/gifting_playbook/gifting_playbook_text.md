# Internal Friends & Family Gifting Setup

## Why This is Important

Worry less about remembering birthdays and stop always buying gifts at the last minute.

## Buying Gifts Instructions

During Christmas, I added everyone's gifts to this Airtable, along with sources I looked at for gift ideas, and other helpful info. Right now, it's only fully complete for family and last year (excluding birthdays and Mother's Day).

For 2021, the main place to look first is the "Gift Events" tab.

You have my Airtable login via LastPass now and can just log into it as me, but if you prefer, I can share your email on that Airtable base.

## What I'd like your help with:

1. Check this Airtable every ~1-2 weeks on the "Gifts Event" tab
2. If it's around the time to start looking for gifts (this is auto-generated in Airtable), then:
3. Review what we bought them last time ("Gifts")
4. Check "Sources" based on their "Interests" for gift ideas
5. Email me 5-10 gift ideas with links / prices
6. Once we decide what to buy people:
7. Buy it and send it to their address (Use chase sapphire reserve card)
8. Pre-draft a message for them w/ the estimated arrival date(s);
9. For now, send this to me on WhatsApp and I'll send this via iMessage since I'm not sure how to give you my iMessage/Apple ID login yet.
10. Add the gift to "Gifts" tab for record-keeping
11. Update the "Gift Events" tab
12. Add the place we bought it and brand to the "Brands & Stores" tab
