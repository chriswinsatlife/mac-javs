# Frequently Asked Questions
Your Athena Membership
What are Athena’s Membership requirements?
There are no formal requirements to become an Athena Member. However, we are a two-way partnership so we do an initial call to make sure there’s a mutual fit. Whether you run a household, a small business, an enterprise company, or just your own busy life, Athena supports all types of leaders who are ready to live better and realize their full potential.
What services come with an Athena Membership?
Every Athena Member gets a full-time dedicated Executive Partner (XP), twice monthly coaching sessions with an Athena Executive Coach (XC), and ongoing support from the Athena team.
Can I choose to work only with an Executive Coach or only with an Executive Partner (XP)?
The Athena Membership is designed as a comprehensive system. Your Executive Coach and your Executive Partner are both critical members of your integrated support team that work together to help you prioritize your goals, delegate more effectively, and get more done across work and life. We currently do not offer standalone XP or coaching services.
What happens if I need more support than my membership includes?
Your Athena team is prepared to meet your needs, wherever they are. If you need extra support, reach out to your Partnership Manager and they’ll take it from there.
Is there a minimum commitment period for membership?
The value of an Athena Membership compounds over time. To give you the best results, we require a one year commitment.
Do I keep the same Executive Partner (XP) if I renew my membership?
Your dedicated XP will remain with you throughout your membership, strengthening the member-XP relationship over time. A change would only occur in the rare circumstance that issues arise.
Getting started with Athena
What does onboarding look like, and how long will it take?
Onboarding is designed to give your membership the strongest start. The process begins with an intake survey to determine your delegation habits, work style, and goals. This is followed by a 90-minute onboarding call where we’ll create a tailored action plan. You’ll then be matched with your Executive Partner (XP) and Executive Coach (XC), and have a kick-off call, and you’ll complete a Delegation Foundations training. In total, you’ll spend between 2 - 5 hours with our team as you prepare to officially launch your partnership.
What is the typical lead time for working with an XP and Executive Coach?
Once you sign your membership agreement, the full onboarding process typically takes 2-3 weeks. During times of high demand, it can occasionally take longer, but we’ll set clear expectations during your initial sales calls so you know what to expect.
Why is the upfront time commitment so important?
We’ve learned a great deal after facilitating over 20,000 Assistant-Member partnerships. The members who find the most success are the ones who fully engage in onboarding and the initial months, transferring full-life context and building shared systems.
While demanding for time-strapped members, this early investment pays off in the long run. The onboarding phase with your XP and Coach is when you build trust, share context, and set the foundation for collaboration. This upfront effort lays the groundwork for a strong, sustainable relationship.
Who do I receive support from during onboarding?
You’ll be supported by many members of the Athena team throughout your onboarding period. The information you share during your sales conversations is passed along to your Onboarding Associate, who will guide your initial onboarding call, deliver your personalized action plan, and capture your preferences and immediate needs so we can match you with the right Executive Partner (XP) and Executive Coach (XC). You’ll also attend a session with one of our Delegation Trainers, who will equip you with practical delegation tactics to bring to your partnership. Finally, you'll meet your XP and your Partnership Manager (PM), who will officially launch your partnership and help get you booked into your initial and recurring coaching sessions.
About your Executive Partner (XP)
How does working with Athena differ from a virtual assistant or a traditional staffing company?
Unlike virtual assistants and traditional staffing agencies, Athena partnerships provide security, training infrastructure, and long-term tenure. A traditional executive assistant is narrow in scope. While an EA does tasks, an Athena XP integrates themselves into the full scope of your life to transform the way you work and live.
Why should I hire an Athena XP instead of hiring an EA on my own?
Hiring your own executive assistant is high-risk, time-consuming, costly, and results in shorter tenures. Athena does the work for you. We start with the top 1% of applicants, perform thorough background and reference checks, and provide in-person training and ongoing education. Every Executive Partner (XP) has a personal manager and an extensive network of peers they can rely on to answer their questions. And to take additional work off your plate, your XP is employed through Athena and we handle payroll, benefits, compliance, and data security.
How does Athena select XPs?
We receive nearly 1000 applications daily, of which only 1% are accepted. Every XP undergoes our rigorous vetting and evaluation process. We screen each candidate for soft skills and aptitude. Before becoming eligible to be partnered with you, they must take personality, cognitive, and English tests and undergo immersive training on real-world tasks, including calendar, travel, and inbox management.
Can my XP support both my professional and personal life?
Yes. Your Athena XP can assist you personally, professionally, and in all the moments where the two overlap.
Does my XP work with any other clients?
No, your XP works with you and no one else. After thousands of partnerships, we’ve determined that a one-to-one relationship is the most effective and yields the strongest results for both members and XPs.
Can I share my XP with my executive team and/or business partner?
​​No. Athena offers one-to-one, dedicated partnerships. Your XP will occasionally support colleagues and loved ones (organizing a team offsite or family trip), but you are their one-and-only delegator. We do not allow sharing because your Athena Executive Partner is unlike any other direct report—their primary focus is to help you achieve your goals.
What time zone does my XP work in?
Athena XPs are located overseas but work on a schedule determined by your needs. Most members choose to have their XPs work in their time zones, but you may also choose to work asynchronously.
What happens if I go on vacation or take time off? What does my XP do?
Your XP will continue supporting your needs during your absence. If their support is not required, they may take paid time off while you are away.
How does Athena ensure continuity if my XP is unavailable (sick, leave, etc.)?
We ensure continuity of support by assigning you a temporary XP to handle your top-priority tasks whenever your permanent XP is on leave.
What happens if the partnership with my XP isn’t working out?
Rarely, a partnership doesn't work out. If this happens, your Partnership Manager will address any concerns or performance issues and work to resolve them. We will partner you with a different Athena XP if things don't improve.
How we train and support your XP
What training does Athena provide my XP?
Your XP undergoes extensive training, including on-site classroom work, apprenticeship, and shadow sessions with Athena leaders and high-performing, experienced XPs. This foundation is reinforced with ongoing, one-to-one mentorship from their manager and continuing education to advance their skill sets.
How does Athena train XPs to use AI tools effectively?
We train every XP to use AI to enhance their work — not as a shortcut, but as a way to work smarter. XPs are provided with an Enterprise ChatGPT license and receive guided training on how and when to incorporate AI into their tasks to boost efficiency while maintaining high standards. They also stay up-to-date with continued education, tool updates, and real-world practice, so they know how to integrate AI with sound judgment.
How does Athena ensure a balance between human judgment and AI assistance?
At Athena, we see AI as a partner, not a replacement. We teach XPs to use AI for speed and automation, but to always layer in human expertise for context, decision-making, and relationship building. This balanced approach ensures your XP is efficient and effective but delivers work with a human touch.
Can an XP be trained on my company’s specific tools and systems?
Absolutely. While our core training ensures every XP is proficient in the most commonly used stack of tools, they're fully prepared to learn your unique systems and workflow to integrate into your operations. We suggest you allow for a brief ramp-up period for any tools or processes that are particularly specialized or new.
How does my XP receive payment?
Your XP is employed and paid by Athena. They also receive health insurance, pet insurance (one of our most popular benefits), social perks, and mental health support.
What benefits does my XP receive?
Athena offers the following to every XP:
- Continuous training and programs for upskilling
- Best-in-class Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) for the XP and their family
- Pet Reimbursement Program
- Established communication channels to share things they've learned, exchange best practices, and celebrate achievements
- Mental health support
Does my XP receive PTO, and how does the process work?
By contract, your XP is entitled to 20 days of paid time off per year (used for holidays, personal events, etc.). They will seek approval from Athena first. This process is in place because each type of leave has corresponding qualifications, conditions, and limitations. If Athena approves the PTO, your XP will then request your approval. If they need longer extended leave, your Partnership Manager will coordinate the necessary training, shadow sessions, and meetings to ensure your life-work flow isn't disrupted.
Working with your Executive Partner (XP)
How can my XP help me?
Our onboarding is designed to focus your attention, optimize your time, and manage your energy. Over time, your XP will learn to take on more and more of the administrative and operational tasks on your plate, and to serve as an extension of you.
These are just a few examples of how your XP can help:
- Organizing, drafting and helping to manage your email inbox
- Owning your calendar and scheduling
- Travel planning, booking and coordination
- Personal and professional research
- Submitting and tracking invoices
- Meeting notes and follow-ups
Are there best practices for setting up my XP’s work schedule?
We recommend a fixed working schedule with daily overlap between you and your XP, especially at the beginning of the partnership. Many XPs start one hour before their client to complete inbox sweeps and brief them at the top of the day. As the partnership evolves, you can shift to whatever schedule works best for you and your XP.
How many hours a week does my XP work?
Every Athena XP works 40 hours per week (five business days) with two consecutive days off. You can discuss your preferences with your XP.
What happens if my XP works more than 40 hours some weeks?
Some weeks will be busier than others, but if your XP consistently works more than 40 hours a week, we recommend bringing on an additional Athena XP.
How do I provide feedback on my XP’s performance?
Our most successful partnerships provide real-time, direct feedback on a daily basis. During onboarding, we'll check in regularly, facilitate feedback sessions to get you up and running, and send out regular surveys to make sure your partnership is progressing.
What if I ask my XP to do something they can’t do?
If a request falls outside your XP’s scope, they’ll let you know right away. If it’s something your XP can develop the capability to support, your Partnership Manager will help define a path for your XP to take it on. If it’s not something we can cover, your XP will connect you with the right service partner or solution to get it done.
Executive coaching at Athena
What type of coaching is included with membership?
Executive Coaching is included with every membership. Executive coaching is a professional development process where experienced coaches work one-on-one with leaders and executives to enhance their leadership effectiveness, decision-making abilities, and overall performance. This collaborative partnership typically results in improved leadership presence, better strategic thinking, enhanced emotional intelligence, and ultimately stronger business outcomes for both the individual leader and their organization.
Who are the coaches, and what is their background?
Athena coaches are seasoned, certified executive coaches with experience in nearly every type of business and focus area. They have thousands of hours of experience coaching founders and senior leaders.
How often do I get access to coaching sessions?
Members receive two comprehensive 1-hour coaching sessions each month, designed to provide in-depth support and guidance. In addition to these dedicated sessions, members also benefit from asynchronous communication channels throughout the month.
Can my XP join coaching sessions with me?
If you would like to use a session to work on strengthening your relationship with your XP or to align on goals, you are welcome to invite your XP to the session. Otherwise, it is recommended that you attend the sessions alone.
Can coaching be tailored to my personal or business goals?
Athena Executive Coaching offers a self-directed approach, allowing you to customize the focus of each session based on your individual goals, current experiences, and challenges. Our coaches follow your lead while checking in on your previous commitments and goals.
Your privacy and security
What measures are in place to ensure security, privacy, and confidentiality?
We take security, privacy, and confidentiality very seriously. Every XP undergoes a comprehensive third-party background check, with character references verified and previous employers contacted.

Information Security Awareness Training is required annually for all employees. Learn more about our [Security Measures](https://www.athena.com/security).
