description: "Grant Achatz was diagnosed with tongue cancer and lost his sense of taste at the height of his culinary career. But that didn’t stop him. He built one of the most celebrated restaurant groups in the world. Delegation wasn’t a fallback. It was how he pushed the vision forward and redefined leadership in the kitchen."
