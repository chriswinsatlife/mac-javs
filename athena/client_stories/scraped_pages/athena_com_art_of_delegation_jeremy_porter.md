title: "How Jeremy Porter Delegates to Build a World-Class Racetrack"
description: "Jeremy Porter turned a wild idea into Atlanta Motorsports Park and kept building. With no money, he launched a green racetrack during a recession. He lives by one rule: the day you stop learning is the day you start to become obsolete. He leads by hiring for heart, delegating with clarity, and always pushing for what's next."
