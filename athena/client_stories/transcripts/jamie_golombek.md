## Transcript

My name is Jamie. I'm a tax expert, a CPA, and most importantly, a huge Dave Matthews fan. And today, I'm gonna teach you how to delegate leveraging authenticity. We're gonna talk about bringing your full self to work no matter what. And by bringing your full self, you're gonna have a huge impact on communicating with your team members. I never thought I would actually go specifically into this. I was always interested in business. I was interested in numbers. In fact, from an early age, my favorite subjects in school, in fact, the ones I did the best at were math. In high school, I took all 3 math courses, and I got in the high nineties in all 3 of them. But I thought, you can't really make a career out of math. What can you do with math? I decided, well, business, numbers, how can I make money with numbers? Ultimately, that led me to take an accounting and finance specialization and a commerce degree at McGill University. When I graduated, I wanted to take the highest paying job that was offered. But I spoke to my dad and he said, you know what Jamie, you can always get a high paying business job, but why don't you also get a professional designation? And in fact, he was the 1 who encouraged me rather than taking the highest paying business job out of university to instead pursue the CPA designation. And that's what I did. So I spent a couple of years toiling away in 1 of these big CPA firms. It was miserable, the work was hard, It was challenging. It was not interesting. It was actually quite boring. After a couple of years, I decided that the real value was in tax because taxes actually save people money as opposed to preparing financial statements and doing audits where people see very little value. So I switched into the tax department a couple years after that. I worked there for a couple years and decided this is where the action is because you're actually saving real people, real money, and there's true value in that and people are willing to pay for it. I think my my real core value is to be authentic and I like to bring my whole self to work. I'm a big music fan. I love live theater. I like sports and I talk about this in every client meeting before we actually get into tax savings. So we were out with some clients just last night for dinner, and we started talking about music and sports and what's going on with the Raptors, which we won't talk too much about today. But ultimately, we make a connection. And if you can make a personal connection, you start to build trust. And that is ultimately where all the relationships go. Look, our firm manages money, so does every other firm on the street. Our returns are good, but so are all the other returns. How can we stand out? We can stand out with great advice, but also with relationships. And if we can build that relationship with a personal interest or a story or some kind of connection, then the rest is there. Trust is there and that builds long term relationships, long term trust and ultimately it's good business.

Well I think the key to really making things click for me is having the right team of people. I'm very fortunate that my immediate team, which is a very small team of a couple of people, have been with me personally over 10 years. And the idea is that we all know each other, we're all experienced, and I actually trust them. In fact, I would trust them more than I trust myself. If I give them something to do, they're gonna do it and they're gonna do it right, not always, not always perfect, not the way I would do it necessarily, but eventually they get to know my style. So, you know, most recently we had some major tax changes here in Canada that involved some uncertainty with the capital gains tax. So I had a team meeting last week and I said, team, we need to come up a with some new slides for this presentation I'm doing last week because that presentation was already outdated because of this new uncertainty on the capital gains tax. So can you come up with a couple of slides right at the top of the presentation that sort of governs and I send them 3 HTML links from articles that was just in the newspaper that morning. So a couple hours later, I get back a couple of PowerPoint slides. It looks good. There's a graphic the person has chosen. And I said, okay. This is good. There's too much text. Can you just reduce the text? I don't tell them what to reduce. I don't tell them how to do it. And literally half an hour later, comes back. It's ready to go. I insert it into the presentation and away we go. So if you have a team that you trust, you're able to easily delegate. And again, you provide them with feedback and that allows us all to be efficient and to accomplish way more. I could have done it myself. Look, I I'm on top of this topic, like, out. In fact, I knew the stuff inside out and cold by heart, but I don't wanna do it. I want a team to do it because they're the expertise in PowerPoint, they're the expertise in choosing the right graphics, and they know how to take this HTML, this web story, and make it into 3 or 4 concise points. I can refine it later on, but I really trust the team. And having a great team allows me to be even more successful. We get comments after my presentations, and I speak 80 to a 100 times a year across Canada to both individual investors, to advisers, to retirees, to clients. And we always get comments. Jamie, great slides. Can I get a copy of your deck? Of course, that's no problem, but again, I don't actually write the stuff. I come up with the ideas, I come up with the concepts, but we have a team of people, not just on my team that has the technical tax expertise. 1 is a tax lawyer, 1 is a tax CPA, We also have a multimedia team that knows exactly what the right font size is and how big it should be and what the graphics and what the accessibility features are. That whole team does everything and they make me look great. So I think it's very important to hire properly and it's hard to know whether you have the right person off the gate. So we bring them in and we see how it goes. Every contract usually has a 3 month probationary period to see how it works out And, we start assigning tasks, sometimes simple, a bit more complex, and then see what comes back. And then we provide feedback. And ultimately, that's a way that they grow in their careers. I learn from them as well. I have learned so much from the people that I delegate to because they have a different view, a different perspective, and sometimes I'm wrong. Like, sometimes I interpret some new tax thing in a certain way, and they come back to me and said, but, Jamie, don't you remember that there was this case 10 years ago that looked at it differently? I'm like, Oh yeah, I forgot about that or I never even knew about it. So again, I am learning from that team and again, we work so well together right now that it's really a non issue.

I think that communication is ultimately the key to business success, especially if you're working in a team, because it takes the mystery out of what's actually going on. So I make sure that we have a team meeting every Monday morning at 10AM no matter what, unless I'm, you know, out of town or on vacation or something like that. But and then we reschedule it. But we make sure that every Monday morning we have a team meeting where everyone has a chance, an equal chance to talk. We go in order and, what's on their mind, what's coming up for the week, what are our goals and priority for the week. But then it doesn't stop there with that Monday meeting. We actually have regular communication throughout the entire day. Sometimes we'll use email chats if we're sending out third party information or new tax changes. Sometimes we'll engage in a Microsoft Teams chat where we actually have an ongoing chat about a specific topic. But again, the more we share, the more value it is. No one's in the dark. We learn from each other. People come up with new ideas. They share them among the team. And I do encourage the team to always bring new ideas forward. You know, our mandate is to write numerous reports on every possible topic on tax planning and estate planning. And if a a team member ever has an idea, you know, I say just send it along. And I'd say most of the ideas that we've had for new reports, you know, I've been doing this for, you know, the company for 16 years, we've exhausted pretty much every topic. But I would say most of the ideas for new reports actually comes from the team, not from me. Occasionally, I'll come up with an idea, but really it's the team that's actually sending me ideas. And I actually do this throughout the organization. Every time I do a town hall meeting and I do a keynote address, at the end of that, I put up the website of our team and say, guys, if you have questions. But also, we're always looking for content. Please send us ideas. What are the challenges you're finding out there? Is there a piece that we're missing that explains a certain area better? Could we write that for you? So we're always inviting feedback from the broader team and the broader organization at work. Just recently, we had a situation where there was a change in 1 of the tax laws, and I had read about this case that someone had sent to me. In fact, it just happened yesterday, and someone from our Denver office actually sent me a case that I had not seen out of The United States that applies to cross border tax between US citizens living in Canada. And I thought, wow, this is gonna be a game changer, for all The US citizens living here in Canada that have to file a cross border tax. It actually could save them a ton of money. So I sent it to the team. The team did not know this. And in fact, they thanked me for sending it to them because we were sharing that information. I wasn't keeping this information selfishly to myself to make me look great. I was saying, hey, someone sent this to me. I didn't know about this. Maybe you guys didn't know about it either. So I sent it to them. We had a brief discussion about it afterwards, but I think we all grew from that opportunity. I really believe in giving people Slack that they need, in fact, to accomplish everything on their own and only provide feedback when they ask for it. So ultimately, I really believe that people are smart and people want to succeed, at least the people that we hire and the people that we work with. And I really leave them alone because there's just so many smart people in so many different areas and they all add value far beyond what I could do on my own.

Initially when I first sort of had a team record it to me, was a bit nervous about it. In other words, are they really gonna do it the same way that I would have done it? Would it be exactly what I want? Would they choose the right, you know, messaging? Would the slides be exactly how they wanted? And the truth is that it actually was not at all what I had in mind, But that didn't matter because I learned to live with it. In fact, sometimes it was better than what I would have thought on my own. So ultimately, initially, I was very nervous about it. But then, you know, if you hire the right people and the people are smart and you trust them, they're going to come back with something that will be more than you could have even imagined. And that's ultimately been my experience is that now I think my team can deliver a better product than I can because ultimately they're the experts in let's say PowerPoint. They know the rules inside out and they can basically I've done this so many times before. They know what I'm looking for and ultimately I have full trust in that team. But initially it's hard and I think you just have to provide feedback and you say yes, I like this, I didn't like this. They get to learn your style and now it really is second nature. I really rarely provide any feedback at all. I would say 9 times out of 10 everything comes back perfect. Initially I was quite a little bit guilty about it because here I was dealing a presentation in front of 3 or 400 people and I didn't write every word of it myself. Now, certainly, I had the concepts and saying we should talk about this and talk about this, but some of that stuff on that slide, I didn't write. But I'm delivering it as if it was my own. But I've learned to live with that because ultimately, this is the team that we put together and ultimately, I'm responsible for the final product and for the content. There was once a situation where there was a technical problem I was trying to solve and I really got into it and I was really trying to figure out, I was looking at 1 of the tax publications and I could not figure out how they got a certain number. And I really spent 2 or 3 hours crunching through this example. I just couldn't figure it out. And ultimately, I sent it to the team. I said, hey, guys. Do you have any idea why they came up with this rate of return? Because I've honestly spent 3 hours on this and I couldn't figure it out. And literally 10 minutes later, 1 of the team members said, yes, they're using this assumption. I'm like, oh, of course. Why did I spend 3 hours? It was a terrible idea. Why was I embarrassed just to say, I don't know. I don't understand, and send to the team in the first 10 minutes? Like, spend 10 minutes on it. Great intellectual challenge, but I can't figure out. Send it to the team, let them figure it out. Because it literally took them 10 minutes to figure out. So that's an example where, you know, initially, I didn't delegate because I thought I should be I'm the team leader. I should know this. I should be I'm smart enough. I should figure this out. I just couldn't figure it out. I missed an assumption. What were they assuming? Right away, other team member with a different perspective say, yeah, but they're assuming this. I'm like, oh, of course they are. As soon as they plug that in, the spreadsheet worked, matched the same number. My first real experience with delegation in which I was the delegatee, if you could say that, and ultimately what happened was I was working for a big national CPA firm. I was the most junior accountant there in tax season. A partner would come into my office and drop a big envelope full of receipts and said, Jamie, prepare this return. I didn't know what I was doing, but I went into the software, I prepared a draft of the return, and then I put it on the partner's desk. The partner never reviewed it. The partner takes the return and returns it to 1 of his managers. The manager then did a detailed review and then gave it back to me and said here are all the mistakes that you made. The manager didn't correct them. It Would would have been easier for the manager just to go into the software and make these changes, but no. It was a learning opportunity. I learned all so much from that. So then I would go back and then I returned it to the manager. He would make these changes, approve them, and ultimately, when it was finalized, he would then give it to the partner who would sign off and then tell the client that the tax return was ready. So in other words, from a very junior stage where I was the most junior person on the file, I really learned about delegation. That's how I learned at the end of the day. Because at the end of the day, if I just made mistakes and never knew how to fix them, how would I not make that same mistake over and over and over again? Delegation is ultimately about the growth of the entire team. Because how else are people gonna learn? Like, if I just do everything myself and I don't really dedicate anything to anybody else, how is the team members going to evolve and grow and ultimately gain more technical expertise so that they can ultimately advance their personal careers and their personal growth? So again, we can look delegation as selfish because I want to save time and I don't want to do it myself and this is drudgery, or we can look at it as an opportunity for the whole team to learn and grow from each other and ultimately succeed in every career they want.

For me, 1 of the core principles that I often use is storytelling, where it's telling a story about personal life, something I did on the weekend, a concert I went to, a play I saw, or ultimately tax a tax based storytelling because every day I read all the case law that comes out and there are some very interesting stories of what taxpayers are at least trying to do before they get caught by the tax authorities. So, you know, storytelling is very important. And if we can start a meeting with a storytelling story with actual story in terms of here's what I read on the weekend or here's this story, what it does, it certainly builds trust among the team. It sort of creates also a level of informality where people sort of feel comfortable sharing ideas with each other and it makes it easier to trust each other and ultimately to be able to delegate and work together as a team. I would say that tax is a very abstract and technical topic, But when you make it about real people, when you tell a story of either a personal situation I mean, 1 of the stories that I often tell at the end of my presentations is a personal tax challenge that I have had with the Canada Revenue Agency. I actually talk about my own personal stories where they challenged my home office expenses, or years ago, they challenged my transit pass credit, and I actually have slides of pictures of me fighting with the CRA about these things. It really does build sort of a level of trust, and it really shows that I'm a real person too. I'm not just a leader. I'm not just a business person. I am an actual taxpayer, and I will fight for my $98 of taxes, John Principal, just like everybody else. It makes a great story, but ultimately it shows that we're all human, we're all in this together, and we're all trying to ultimately pay the least amount of tax possible. I think for success you've got to bring yourself to work at the end of the day. Mean, that certainly has worked for me, it works for the team. I don't need to know every personal detail of what's going on with your children and your dog and medical issues like that I don't need to know. But at the end of the day, you know, what did you do on the weekend? Tell me something interesting. Maybe we can connect over that. Otherwise, it's all fake. What's the point of it? I love waking up and going to work because I make real connections with people. I find the job very, very interesting. There's new developments every single day. But if I had to hide myself and pretend that I wasn't at a show last night or I didn't do something fun on the weekend because you didn't do something fun, well what's the fun in that? I really love work and for me it's not work. It's just something I do every day and it allows me to do all the other stuff that I like to do in my spare time.

Well the way I like to sort of look at my life is that my life is not work. Work allows me to live my life and I do a lot of stuff. Like at least 3 nights a week I'm either at live theater, live music, or a live sporting event. I'm out with friends, I'm doing stuff with the community, I'm on the boards with 4 different charities, I have a board meeting tonight, like I'm very involved with stuff. And to be able to do all that, it's really important to be very efficient at work. So I wake up early in the morning. I start working 2, 3 hours in the morning before everybody else is up, before even the dog is up. And I get those few hours in there first thing in the morning. Then the rest of the day, have a very strong team. And as tasks come in, as things come in, we have sort of prioritized that. We have a weekly Monday kickoff meeting every Monday morning. We look at the entire week's schedule as a team and we say who's doing what for this week, what are our goals for the week, and be back being efficient at work, it allows me to really spend my free time free. I don't work on the weekends. I spend the weekend with the family, with the dog, and doing fun stuff. So for example, just the other day I had a big presentation in Ottawa, but the problem was that the night before I had a concert that I was going to go to with a friend in Toronto. How could I possibly do both in terms of being prepared for the presentation and ultimately getting on a plane, flying to Ottawa, giving the presentation? But the good news is that we've got a great team of people. So a week before the presentation, I work with the team at work. So this is kind of what I'm thinking. Let's do these slides. We went back and forth. They sent the slides in advance to the Ottawa team. I was able to stay in Toronto the night before the presentation, fly out that morning. I literally show up in the venue. Everything's set up. The slides are loaded. The mic is set up, I literally walk on stage, give the presentation. So being able to basically delegate most of the technical side of the preparation, the advance work to a team of people, I was able to literally spend more time doing the things that I want to do and rely on that team to take care of all the logistics of getting that presentation on queue, on time for me so that I could stay that extra day in Toronto.
