## Transcript

This entire thing started with me and friends racing, and we would just hang out at racetracks and be under the tent and talk about racing and and racetracks and things of that nature. So I said 1 time to my friends, why don't we build a track? And they said that's a great idea.

My name's Jeremy Porter. I'm the CEO of Atlanta Motorsports Park. And 1 of my core values is the day you stop learning is the day you start to become obsolete. So I became friends with the CEO of Road Atlanta, and he and I had a discussion about building a second track at Road Atlanta by turning 12. So he paid me to write a business plan. I was in my twenties. And so we wrote the business plan and designed the track and everything happened. Well, it went up the food chain to the chair of the the Panos companies and then to the owner of all the Panos companies. And, that gentleman said, since I have to make a decision, I'm gonna make no decision at all. So I really couldn't get it out of my head or heart. So that was back in 2000. In 2007, we're all sitting under a tent again at a racetrack drinking beer. And my buddies and I said, let's build a racetrack. And they said, let's do it. Well, in 2007, money was, you know, prevalent. If you had a pulse, you could get a check. And a buddy of mine was the COO of SunTrust, and he said, yeah. We'll help fund you. So we launched the website, and 2008 happened, and everybody disappeared. So I'm sitting there with the website and no money, no experience, no experience raising capital or zoning or any of those things. And, I thought, you know, the opportunity to try this is more interesting, and the motivation of fear behind me to be able to push me forward on this was 1 thing that kinda kept me propelled forward into it.

You know, in 02/1989, there was no money, and there was no development really happening. In the state of Georgia, we were the only large to medium project in the entire state of Georgia. You know, building a motor sports country club, people were like, you're building a what? The EPD was here sometimes 2 to 3 times a week when they would not visit a project for a year. So capital wasn't there. The subcontractors were struggling because they had no work. Then we were in a lawsuit, for 5 and a half years, went all the way up to supreme court with a horse farm. Cost us about $750,000, which is 750,000 more than we had. And so it was navigating and cash flowing that as we were going because surprisingly, we never missed a payment, not once. So it all worked out.

So the other thing, 1 of the guiding principles is creativity over capital. So when you have no money, when you start something like this, this is a capital intensive project. You have to be creative. So I didn't spend money on anything. I would bring people to go get coffee instead of lunch because that would save a little bit of money. I bartered 2 and a half million dollars in things around the track for advertising along the track. And so it was really just getting into that, just being creative and being resourceful. And, you know, 1 of the other values is the day we stop learning is the day we start to become obsolete. So we're consistently learning. We're consistently looking at new things. We're consistently asking why. Why do you do this? How can we do this better? Let's take a step back, and let's look at things. So I'm addicted to innovation in a in a bad way.

You know, 1 of our core values is, many minds make good decisions. So we look at people and try to find people, and we look at their personality, and we look at their motivation and their heart. And that is really a a key driver of who we find and who we move into, positions within the company. We just recently hired a new COO, and he came from completely outside of the industry from Country Club of the South, which is a golf country club, but just exceptional golf country club, great user experience. So hiring experts and looking for people with the right talent and stuff that we do not have internally is a lot of research, a lot of phone calls, talking to a lot of different people. And then that's many minds make better decisions. There is no expert. There's not a lot of experts in this industry. So analyzing the data that we've received from all these other tracks and operators and figuring out what works or what doesn't. But once we do find somebody, we make sure that the agreement is clear. We make sure the objectives are clear. And then setting a clear endgame of what we're trying to achieve together. And then really managing them to that, holding them accountable and and letting them be free, but also inspecting what you expect. I like to do things quickly, and sometimes I just want to do them myself. But to be able to scale and to be able to do things at a greater rate, you have to delegate to other people. And you have to have people that you can trust and then teach them, hey, this is what I need. These are kind of the the guardrails, and this is the end game. And then let them go with it. And then they'll bring back whatever the project is. But if you continue to work with them and look for that end result and come together as a team, it really helps. And it allows you to do many more things better.

In the industry, being a motorsports country club 12, 13 years ago was something completely unique. There was very few of us. So that was something that was completely different than everybody else did. And then we made this more of a real estate play than just a standard country club. So we had a blend of real estate. We had the the country club side, and then we had diversification of revenue streams relative to the go kart track and everything else. So 1 of the things that I like is having that diversification and having that access to additional revenue streams within the business to keep the business stabilized. So in this industry, every race track goes bankrupt 1 to 2 times in the first 10 years. So that fear of failure, drove me to be able to try to find different revenue streams and bring, you know, this thing to be solid. We had our own on-site level 3 superchargers that was unusual. I believe we're the first track in the world to have those. We had level twos. And how that started was a buddy of mine said, hey. Tesla will put in some chargers at your racetrack for free. And I thought, well, nobody's gonna use them. That was 8 or 9 years ago. But what's interesting is it'll give us some marketing perspective because we'll be an access point for EV chargers on Tesla's website. So I said, yeah. Let's let's put in the chargers. So I talked to the Tesla guys, and they said, how many do you want? And I was being funny, and I said, 10. And they said, okay. And then we iterated it as it relates to thinking, okay. This racing in the EV side of things might be something that's interesting as well. Everybody's scared of it. Everybody thinks the cars are gonna burn to the ground. The track's gonna burn to the ground. So we did a lot of research and worked with a lot of different companies. Then we ended up building a Tesla race car. It's called an Ascension by unplugged. And this thing's about 2 to 3 seconds faster a lap than a GT 3 RS around the track, which is saying a lot. And then the last thing that we just built is we have a half meg solar farm that is the largest solar farm in the Amicola Power Region, and it offsets, I think, 68% of our energy. So it's an oxymoron. It's it's something that's unusual in our industry because usually we're the guys burning fossil fuels.

It's funny. I'm a bit of a tree hugger, which is strange in the world of racing and racing myself and being in the racetrack world. We wanted to be different. And so when I launched this, it was in 2007, 2008, and green and sustainability were kind of a thing, but not a big thing, especially in Georgia. So we wanted to be the only ground up green sustainable track in the world, and that started started from from the the beginning. So just took a step back and looked at things and looked at how we could offset our carbon footprint and we started with the entrance. The sign at the entrance is all LED. It's solar powered. All our CCTV is solar powered. Waterless urinals, solar powered hand fixtures. Then we added the half meg solar farm here as well. So we're just trying to be better and better stewards of the environment and take care of people so our kids and their kids can, you know, enjoy this planet because there's no reason why we can't lessen our impact. And then it's a feel good thing. So the members know that this is kind of 1 of our core values and strategies. So they feel good about spending money here. So they can say, hey. I'm ripping around a racetrack in a race car, this company and us, we're dedicated to, you know, you know, reducing climate change.

So, the Circuit Villas are a 3 story kind of black monolith ultra modern circuit side villa. So they're sound between 2 racetracks, and they have 2 decks cantilevered. They're gunmetal gray, steel exterior, you know, panoramic sliding glass walls to open up the whole entertainment space, you know, ultra high end. And we launched these, and this was something that's really unusual in our industry and hasn't really been done. People have done some houses around tracks and things of that nature. But we launched the email on Tuesday, and we've sold, I think, $5,400,000 in villas. So to launch it and to go out into the market and say, is this gonna work? Is the price right? Is the look right? Is the all the fit and finish right? I'm pretty blown away because when we launched the condos, in a week, sold 3 and a half million dollars. So we've blown away that number on these villas. So pretty damn excited.

I think motorsports is in an interesting time right now because it's become even more popular with Drive to Survive. It's really looking towards the future and looking towards autonomous vehicles and how that's going to impact. Because my opinion in the next 5 to 10 years, there's going to be so much fewer people driving because of autonomy. I think what's going to end up happening is similar to what happened with horses back when they were used for practicality reasons. And then cars replaced horses. And then the wealthy and semi wealthy people owned horses. And the amount of horses that were when it was a practicality versus now is quadruple or tenfold. It's significantly more. So I think that we'll end up being a place that people that don't drive cars actually can come drive cars or go karts. So I think that is what the future holds. But ultimately, our goal is to serve the customer to make sure that their needs are met before they even know that they need things. So it's solving those problems.

I think the biggest thing, the underutilized aspect is the new people coming into an organization. And when they do come into the company, I say, hey, I'm gonna hit you up in about 3 weeks, and I'm gonna ask you, call my baby ugly. Tell me what we're doing right. Tell me what we're doing wrong. I wanna learn. I wanna learn from your view, your new perspective. And I think a lot of times, leaders don't tap into that resource. And I believe that's 1 of the reasons why we're here today. As I mentioned, all racetracks bankrupt 1 to 2 times in the first 10 years. And I think it's because we keep asking, we keep looking, we keep looking at better and newer ways to do things, and the way that we can do that is fresh eyes. So asking those junior staff, asking new staff, not being afraid or defensive when they tell you, hey, your baby's ugly. You know, this area is a mess or this is an idea or have you thought of this or considered that. That is really 1 of the key things that that's helped us.
