## Transcript

My name is Brian Beers. Even a 100,000,000 You know what it's like to own a dumpster business? So I got this call the other day from a business owner. They own that. They're gonna remember that, and then they're gonna next time, that's what they're gonna The entire point of a franchise is to rinse and repeat. As you build that muscle, it just gets stronger and stronger. This is a super important question. It's something that a lot of people struggle with. Being able to they don't grow. And agree that making progress more important than perfection. Time to go out and make it happen. My name is Brian Beers. I run a franchise portfolio that does over 50,000,000 a year. I also help people buy franchises. I help them scale them. It's basically my entire life. I've always had an obsessive personality from a very young age. I get super obsessed about it, something, and then over time, you know, I'll shift into some something else. And I don't try and be everything to everyone. Like, I wanna focus on the things that I'm really good at, which is, you know, seeing opportunities, which is finding great people, which is, like, you know, having that vision to be able to bring everything together, and then building a team around me to then help execute on the things. So delegation is super important to me because it allows me to focus on the few things that I'm really good at. My dad got started in Midas in 1976. He was 22 years old and for, you know, 30 years built, his kind of franchise business. And then I joined the company in 2010 after college and learned it from kind of the ground up. In the beginning, a lot of the obstacles that we had to overcome was changing the culture and bringing new people who kind of saw the vision of of what I was really trying to create and and drive forward. I've always been very entrepreneurial in nature, you know, reading business books and and, you know, having a bunch of small businesses that I kind of ran prior to that. You know, 1 of the benefits of a franchise system is it's a community of owners. And so when I joined, I got very involved. I networked. I became friends with other successful operators all over the country. And so I'd traveled to different parts. I'd sit with them and I'd learn what are they doing to have success in their business and try to figure out what are the things that I could, you know, come back here and and apply to ours. And so, you know, it's this it's this constant process of of learning and trying and reiterating and failing and trying again. And so a lot of it is just just trial by by fire. We've grown a lot through acquisition. Naturally, franchisees wanna sell to other franchisees because of that kind of community aspect where, you know, we know each other, we're friends. I mean, we we're talking to each other, not daily, but on a frequent basis, sharing best practices, ideas, challenges, and so you you know, you build bonds and relationships. You know, often we would structure owner finance deals where we were able to establish, like, some win win deals that would benefit them and and and benefit us. Don't be everything to everyone, but figure out, like, what you're really good at and focus on it. And so for me, like, my ability is is operations. Like, we're we're really good at hiring people, you know, getting them set on what needs to be done, holding people accountable to, do the things every day. And so I don't have to be everything to everyone. I can just focus on what I want as long as I trust that, you know, the people leading those other departments or or other options, you know, I know what they're doing. We're in a very people driven business. Like, our our business entirely is dependent on having great people who can drive it forward every day. You know, the biggest risk for me is is not having great people. And so that's a huge focus of ours. We wanna promote from within whenever possible. These people who are in our organization, you know, we can kind of watch them grow, we can kind of watch them develop, and we would rather take a risk on somebody who maybe doesn't have all, the industry and and the resumes, but we know them as a person, we know they have the ability to learn, And we'd rather invest time in that person than the rest can be taught. I look for the traits that can't be taught to who they are as a person. What do I delegate? Can I have my team handle versus what I can focus you know, it's it's evolved over time? And I think 1 of the biggest challenges, you know, I I've had over years is just, hey, I'm just gonna, like, do the thing. Right? Like, I'm just gonna handle it because that's what maybe I'm I'm used to doing. But then, you know, you realize that then you get tied up doing all these, like, small things and trying to just kinda back up and, like, look at the whole situation and say, like, am I the best person to do this? Like or, you know, is this the the highest dollar per hour activity that I can do? We now have a a CEO of the business, and so it's it's him putting together kind of a plan, bringing it to us, us determining what it is. In the past, I would have went out and reached out to a lot of these owners directly who I had those relationships with. Now the delegation is more of, here's the guy, you know, here's everything that I know about him, and I'm gonna let Colin go and work to negotiate that deal and and act more as, like, kind of the coach and mentor. There's lots of stuff and and, you know, crises and all the things that you'd have running running the the business that we do that, you know, at the end of the day, you know, he's able to handle and he handles it the exact way, if not better than what I would have done. And so a lot of it is just just confidence in decision making. Just kind of like a gut feeling, not not necessarily like there's, like, this key thing, but trust built over time. I don't wanna micromanage. I don't wanna tell them how to do things. I you know, it's it's sometimes a biting the tongue. And, you know, I'm out of the day to day in in a lot of these situations, and so, you know, my natural tendency may might be just to, like, you know, did you do this, this, this, or what about this? And but but I don't know the I don't know it all like I I used to. And so I hold him accountable based on his own plans of the road map of here's where we're at and here's where we're going. If we don't achieve where we're going, then it's then it's back to the drawing board in terms of, you know, the decisions that we made and and the direction moving forward. We don't necessarily have like a branded mission statement, but we we do have these 4 core values. And so what we do every single week, you know, we have a we have a company wide call. And on the call, we go over those 4 values, which are, number 1, they gotta be very driven. Like, we want people who wanna bring it every single every single day, and we we don't have to motivate them. Right? They're they're self motivated. And and so as part of it, 1 of our district managers will will nominate, you know, somebody within the the their district who, you know, shows that value and and they'll tell that story and and will, you know, acknowledge that person, you know, highly accountable. They do the things they say they're gonna do. So same thing. We'll we'll bring up, you know, a technician or a manager or somebody in the organization that week highlighting that, you know, that that value. Somebody who's a team player, so they they you know, we're a team sport here. There's there should be no egos and and no self, you know, promoting. It's it's all about how do we how do we win or lose as a team. So same thing for that. And the people who who have a high level of performance, people who really care about doing great work. And so, you know, those are the 4 things that we hire for. Those are the 4 things that we acknowledge, reward, and also terminate. If we feel that people, you know, aren't bringing it every day and and they're not doing the things they're gonna do and and they care about themselves, like, you know, we'll we'll fire people over that. I'm married to my high school sweetheart, Chrissy. We have 2 beautiful girls. I put a lot of intentional focus on, you know, being present and and and being home. And, you know, I take my daughter to school every morning. I'm I'm normally home by, you know, 4PM during the weekdays. I usually don't I don't work the weekends. You know, a a lot of it has has happened over the years through this, you know, intentional process of replacing myself where, you know, when I was in the weeds and and working, you know, 60 hours a week, like, you know, 8 years ago, you know, that didn't happen. You know, I was I was out every day morning, you know, in the stores, morning to close, and, you know, it it was a real stressor just because I, you know, I wasn't present and my phone was blowing up a 100 times a day because, you know, I was I was hiring people, firing people, training people, running running the stores. And so I I knew that the only way that, like, I could not do that is if I had somebody to to replace me in that role. But the only way that someone could replace me in that role is if, you know, we we were making enough money to to support the salary of that person while, you know, still, you know, making the money that I needed to make. And so that kinda has been the process of our we we gotta grow. So we, you know, we buy more stores, we grow the volume, and then intentionally hiring somebody to replace myself that then frees up my time to have more flexibility in my schedule, to be at home a little bit more, to be able to, you know, have that flexibility. And then that evolution has continued to happen from, you know, being a district manager to then being the COO to then, you know, now me having a full, you know, leadership team that that really runs runs it all. Of the mentors in my life is is Trevor who's been my business coach for the last 4 years or 5 years. It's it's it's been a while. He starts to lose count. But so I've been part of these these masterminds and I noticed that a number of these these high level, high net worth people had business coaches. Right? These these guys who they've, would would pay a lot of money to, who would, you know, challenge them on things, who would hold them accountable, who would break their, like, beliefs, about things. And so, you know, I I had hired Trevor and, you know, he that's exactly what he did for me of asking probing questions, really making me think about, like, where I'm at today, what I where do I wanna go, you know, why do I want that? Right? What are what are these, like, driving forces, you know, on a personal level to to achieve, you know, greatness, to achieve success, to make more money, to, like, you know, have freedom. Like, what whatever it is that's driving you, you know, to really understand, like, what's the values hierarchy around that. And, you know, if you if you understand, like, what's that driving force, then you can, you know, you can plan accordingly. As I continue to evolve and grow and, you know, challenge myself to to think bigger, just having someone, like, in your corner who's able to ask the right questions and to just, you know, make me think a little bit differently and just just challenge me when I need to be challenged because there's not a lot of other people, you know, in my world, who who can do that. 1 of the biggest challenges is creating consistency across everything. Right? Because, you know, as you get bigger, you've you've got bigger, bigger teams. You've got new people. You've got, you know, older people who maybe have habits that, you know, we need to evolve. And so for us, there's a number of different ways we do it. 1 is, you know, through check lists of of simply, you know, these are the things that we we gotta get done every day, every week, every month, you know, whatever the time frame is. The other 1 is kind of a mentality of progress over perfection where I'm not necessarily looking for everything to be totally perfect, but I wanna see progress. Right? I wanna see that we're we're we're always, like, moving in the right direction. And at the store level, you know, we we we do that through training. We're we're we're constantly bringing people in to to to train them on different elements. And we're looking kinda to stack, you know, skill sets, whether that's sales, whether that's customer service, whether that's, you know, operationally. The same with our technicians. Right? We're we're we're trying to enhance their skill sets. And as long as we're continuing to make progress, that's what I view as kind of the the greatest level of success in in how we're consistent in in our performance, in our store image, in our operations, and just like everything that we do. Here are the 3 reasons why delegation is important to me. If I apply all of my superpower to to 1 thing, like, at the end of the day, I'm gonna get way better results than if I try to be everything to everyone, and I'm, like, diluted across a number of factors versus just saying super focused on on 1 thing. The other big 1 is is freedom. Right? Where, you know, if if by by delegating things to a team, delegating responsibilities, delegating, like, tasks, you know, that that other people can handle, you know, that that frees me up from having the 1 to take that urgent call, that email, the 1 that has to be kind of always putting out those fires. And so, that's a big 1 for me as I, you know, work to prioritize the flexibility in my time and schedule. The final benefit of delegating for me is is it's purely financial where, you know, we like, for example, we have an entire team in the The Philippines that does, like, all of our our our our back office work and, you know, at at a much lower cost than than than we can do here. And so when I think about, like, internally, we could do it. Like, I could do the bookkeeping. We could hire somebody to do the bookkeeping internally. We could we could have a whole team that does it. And, you know, and by by building a team, thus, like, delegating the aspects, there's for us financially, we we can make a lot more money and then focus our time and effort and resources on the things that's my 80% that that we can really grow. And so my next big milestone is to hit a $100,000,000 a year in in revenue through our portfolio of franchises that we own. You know, our if we hit that by 2030, that's my target. And we're gonna do it through, continuing to grow in in in Midas. We're gonna continue to grow in in other brands that we're involved in that were many of them are just getting started, we we see huge potential. Then through through partnerships and just finding great people who, you know, we can help accelerate through, you know, all the the resources that we have and and the leadership that that we can help provide. 1 of the biggest mistakes that new franchisees make is thinking because it's simple that it's easy, but it's not. Seeing other people grow, I think, I love to see other people who can have that lightbulb moment. They go and they bet on themselves, they take that risk, then they have you know, success. They they they have good results. They've achieved their their their dreams and and then set that new milestone. I mean, it's it's honestly a lot of why I, you know, help with people who are just getting started. It's the reason I run this mastermind. It's the reason that, you know, I'm I'm very involved in kind of that attribute because it's it's changed my life and, you know, it's been a a big rewarding thing for for me to kinda have those moments and to to bet on myself and to see the results. And so it's it's super rewarding to kind of help other people go along that same path. And, you know, I know that the just the the more people that that I can help kind of grow and achieve their dreams that, you know, karma is pretty powerful and that'll come back and, you know, reward me in in the things that I want to achieve.
