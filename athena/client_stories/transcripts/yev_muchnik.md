## Transcript

The day to day engagement with the legal industry has changed quite a bit. I think a lot of that is already fueled by these web 3 technology tools. And especially with the intersection of blockchain and AI that's empowering that and is kind of the next level of what we are going to see. You're gonna see a lot of AI agents coming into mainstream, acting on behalf of clients and on decision making as well. Maybe even replacing traditional boards and how they make decisions, and then probably just infiltrating into the c suite as well. Our knowledge level and power just continues to improve and grow. I think that's going to make for very sophisticated and informed decision making. My name is Yav Muchnick. I'm a out of the box corporate and securities lawyer based in Denver, Colorado. I run my own law firm called Launch Legal. It's a small boutique based firm that runs on a distributed services model. My personal leadership style is that I delegate a tremendous amount of autonomy and authority to my team, and that's all built out on on trust, on the basis of trust. So it's trust that that somebody will go and sort of do their own deep dive and diligence and and sort of try to figure it out on their own before bringing it back into a collaborative environment and try to solve for things that maybe they don't know for. But really, fundamentally, it's just the, the ability to to delegate and, and trust that somebody will kind of take that that autonomy and that authority and that power and be empowered by it to do the best that they can.

I don't think I ever envisioned running my own law firm. It was more based on responding to demand for the services that we were providing. And we, about 7 or 8 years ago, we started hosting a lot of decentralized community, Web 3 events in a beautiful art space in Downtown Denver in Rhino. And really kind of the need was born out of out of that community. The community demanded it, and so we sort of set up a firm just having the the legal skill set that I previously carried into that, which was corporate and securities, that foundation that everything else was built on. So it was kind of happenstance, and it's just really blossomed organically on its own without having to put much effort into, you know, marketing and, and growth. I do a lot of advocacy and policy work both at the state level and at the federal level. I've, traveled out to DC to advocate on behalf of Coinbase and stand with crypto in the past. It's industry experience that we're trying to bring in into these decision making headquarters and educating them on where the gaps are. I think that's really kind of the the key way that I stay on top of regulatory issues by really taking a part in them and and trying to shape them more positively, not just for people in Colorado, but but as as a country as well and, of course, including my client. I was initially drawn to Web 3 because of financial inclusion and bridging the the wealth equity gap. And so I continue to be very excited about that. I continue to be excited about bringing more women into this space. I'm excited about leveling out something that has very much been distorted over the last decades in terms of just financial opportunity. You know, buy a house now isn't what it was 20, 30 years ago when our parents were in the market and kind of building that wealth over time. So to me, this is really like a a massive paradigm shift as to what Web 3 blockchain, these digital assets can offer for everybody around the globe. So I can I'm I'm incredibly excited because to me that's just the fundamental human right. So I am just, you know, fighting for for more participation in the space and opening up any kind of barriers to entry. Our firm operates on a distributed model insofar as we're able to resource knowledge gaps or staff up pretty quickly and pretty efficiently whenever we have large transactions that walk through the door. For example, we're working on a large $150,000,000 financing now. So we're resourcing tax specialists, employment specialists that can come through and we work as as a whole team instead of sort of being fragmented or having kind of the experience from the client side as anything other than 1 cohesive firm environment. So not only can we fill in practice gaps that we may not have in house or central to the core team, but we can staff up pretty quickly and efficiently too. A big game changer for productivity is being able to figure out how to delegate properly. I think I I struggled with that for a while early on and sort of, you know, just hoarded everything that I had to do, taking that on myself and, you know, going back to that immigrant mentality knowing that it's just everything is on me. I can carry everything on my shoulders. After having sort of lived through many cycles of that, I've realized that, you know, somebody can do certain things better than I can do. And I just need to be able to let go, empower them, you know, have them grow and and and give them the ability to kind of support in that way. But the the delegation piece has been huge creating various kinds of SOPs for the firm and just, you know, kind of protocols which makes us thrive and and be more efficient. 1 of the major lessons that I've learned about trust and delegation is that trust is earned. It can also be given very quickly and taken away just even quicker. So it's it's definitely, you know, kind of part of this integrity bucket that we all bring to the table in a professional environment. And personally, you know, my style is 1 that is not abrupt, so it's I I tend to have kind of more of this runway of, okay. Maybe it didn't work out the first time. Let's try it again. Let's talk about and have an honest dialogue about what went wrong and and and and kind of see how we can fix it, see, like, what your personality or style is, what mine is, and how we can repair that. But, I mean, the runway is not infinite. So we have an incredibly competent and small and mighty team. I guess our a lot of our success is measured by the the the kind of deals that we close, the kind of clients that we attract. And so 1 of our senior counsel is been working very closely with a couple of AI companies. And they've entrusted him pretty deeply and and you know, have given him a lot of new work, have brought in a lot of new referrals based on the relationship that he's developed with him. So I think that that has been, know, just kind of amazing to see that, you know, you can sort of let somebody shine and and take on a lot of like the client management and the client relationship. And it's turned out amazingly. We lead with our values, so they are sort of front and center. And I think that the people that we attract, the the team side and the client side, are very well aware of of those values. So we are mission forward. We believe in, you know, equal access. And I think just because we're so transparent about those things, we attract the same type of people. The culture in the firm is very much, you know, taking care of of the people that work with us. It's not about running them to the bone. It's about, you know, if you need if you need to take the day off, if you need to, like, you know, to go and, you know, pursue whatever makes you happy and that kind of regenerates you or even taking a vacation go take a vacation. Those are things that are so important in in having a healthy team that is is not burnt out, that is supportive, that is operating at their highest level. I can't imagine not leading a team without collaboration and without giving everybody an equal voice and the ability to contribute. I think that we, just as humans, are designed to collaborate and to and that just, you know, takes us to that nth power in terms of what we can achieve and accomplish. And humility, I guess, again, is is more just part of my personality. I mean, I I know that I've done and accomplished quite a bit in in my career and have a lot to be proud of, but it's I think that there's kind of a a right time and place in which to to kind of bring those things up as as having any kind of relevance, but it doesn't make me better or smarter or anything more than than anybody else on my team. And so I think that that level of humility is just necessary just to to speak on the same level. I mean, we're just we're all humans. We all have like basic needs. And in this professional environment, we're trying to learn, become better, know, succeed, service our clients. And so having an ego or any kind of, like, strong personality that that you're superior is just it's not going to cut it. So some of the non negotiables for my team members are curiosity, the ability to have clear communication styles and habits, And I guess integrity which is you know something that is sort of manifests along the way. But usually you can tell when somebody is sort of true to a particular value set. We try to bring in people that are these out of the box thinkers that are open to pivoting because there is a lot of pivots in the type of work that we do and sort of the format from the day to day. But really just kind of approaching problems with a solutions based approach or being solutions oriented with that curiosity that I mentioned. 1 of the of the best decisions that I've I've been warming up to and finally was able to to move forward on was bringing on an an executive assistant. It's just been a total game changer across the board for me both professionally, both personally, and aspirationally. So we've been able to just accomplish so much in terms of organization, in terms of creating space in my life to be more strategic on big picture ideas and big big picture goals that I've set for myself. It's also brought, you know, just a just a level of organization to the personal side, on the family side, and being able to manage kids' school calendars and their busy karate calendars and sports and travel and everything else. But I just it feels very much like there's this level of support that I've not experienced in the past. And a lot of that is fueled by the technology that is in place to support my EA, the kind of the management sort of hierarchy that is built into that particular system and platform that is something that I don't have to think about, that is just kind of just built into the package. And the fact that she's a self starter, she sort of, you know, identifies problems even before I have have them or can vocalize them or it's helped me tremendously across the board. If I could give myself 1 piece of advice early on in my career is would be to just have more confidence. You know, as a baby first year attorney, or first year associate, you're just you're at the whim of senior associates and partners and this hierarchical structure that's embedded into into that system. And I think a lot of, the ideas that I had and the initiatives that I had were sort of silenced because of that built in framework and and structure. And so it's like, for example, I could have brought in a web 3, technology practice or have put it forward for partners to consider early on. You know, it was something that I was timid about. It was just kind of lacking confidence and and the that imposter syndrome that I mentioned early on. You know, find the book, find the mentor, find the teacher who will help you overcome whatever gap that you have, knowledge gap, experience gap. You keep working and you work really hard and you work multiple jobs, you work, you know, until the wee hours That is, very much alive in me, and I'm grateful to my parents for being able to witness that and experience that with them.
