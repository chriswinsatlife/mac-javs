## Transcript

So I'd really only been in New York for about a month when the pandemic really hit. And around March 17, as everyone is locked into home, I emailed my supervisor and said, I'm I'm a trained emergency doctor who has a lot of experience in crisis situations. It doesn't feel right for me to sit at home and not show up for this. So at the time, New York was completely overwhelmed and kind of circling the drain, and the governor asked for any able-bodied, credentialed, nurses, practitioners, doctors to volunteer.

So I signed up on the governor's website. Less than probably 12 hours later, I had someone from a hospital down the street from me call me, and she said, okay. Hold on. Let me get this straight. You're trained in international crisis situations. You're credentialed in all of these procedures. You have, you know, the correct medical licenses, etcetera. You're a 10 minute bike ride away, you're available immediately, and we can have you as long as we want. And I said, yep. That's pretty much it. And she started crying, and I just let her cry for a long time, and she said, this is 1 of those moments where I really feel the beauty of being an American. She said, I've had people from all over the country call me. She said, I have a guy who's been driving nonstop from Texas for the last 14 hours who's willing to, you know, he'll be here tomorrow at 8AM, and she said, I'm just I'm overwhelmed with the amount of support that we're getting. And so it was a really beautiful thing to be able to show up in that way. In a lot of ways, I felt that all of the struggles that I had had in my career and my personal life were preparing me for that moment, and I really felt calm and capable to be able to show up there and show up in a big way. And especially when you're in a career like medicine where you spend 10 years becoming what you're trying to become, it it it can feel really important to give back in that way.

It was a dramatic experience. When I remember back to that time what was so shocking to my American friends is when I would say it's nothing compared to what I've seen abroad. Hi. My name is doctor Erin Strata. I work in global health and emergency medicine, and 1 of my favorite things about delegation is seeing people rise to the occasion and surprise you in new and amazing ways. So there's 3 things I think are really important in terms of delegating especially as a new leader. The first for me was knowing my team. Knowing what skills they have that I don't, knowing what they're interested in and not interested in, knowing what they're likely to be successful in and what they're not. That was really important for me. The second, which was much harder, is learning to take feedback. Learning to admit mistakes and feeling like as a team we could have a thoughtful conversation when things didn't go well and something had to be changed. Whether it was me that did it or whether it was them. Right? And the third thing I would say is being okay asking for help. I don't think any of us are innately born to be perfect leaders. It's okay to ask the advice of people who are more senior than you, people who work in a totally different I've gotten so much advice from friends who do not work in health, who do not work in global health, and it's been some of the most useful advice. So this idea of phoning a friend is absolutely true and important. Getting advice from others, you're not alone in this and you you shouldn't be, in fact. You're you're building your network that no matter what you do in your career, that network of these are the people I go to for advice is still solid and is still there. I originally went to college to become a college football commentator. I was a communications major, Grew up in Nebraska. College football was a big thing. And as I moved to San Francisco for college and was learning more about the world, it was 2001. A lot was changing. A lot of global politics were changing, and I started to become more passionate about working in that space. So I started signing up to go on different what's called service immersion trips, where you're really there to learn about a totally different culture and then be in service to them in some way as part of that exchange. And I found myself in El Salvador learning about the civil war and how that had affected their community. At the time, I spoke no Spanish, and I lived with a host family. And I was really struggling to connect with them because I didn't speak the language. But at the time, I had a lot of eye problems. I had been suffering from these recurrent eye infections, and so I had brought multiple different bottles of an antibiotic solution. And the second day there, 1 of the daughters in that family noticed me putting these drops in her eye and she sort of communicated with her mom and they basically communicated to me that she also had an eye infection. It was very evident. And I gave her 1 of the bottles of drops, and within 2 days, her eye infection was cleared up. And it something really clicked for me in that moment that health is this really unique way that you can connect with people across different cultures and and borders, and it felt really good to be able to do something that was impactful immediately within a specific area. I decided that I needed to go out into the world and learn a lot more, and I chose to do the Peace Corps. For me, was assigned Peru, and I was also, at that time, when they choose your community, they find a family that you are meant to live with. And to me that was a critical advantage to where I was placed into the community that I was in because they became my family. They had my back. They were able to tell me things that nobody else would tell me. We were able to build an intimate trust. The value and belief system and the way of being in the small mountain community that I was in, which was Quechua speaking, had indigenous roots, had a very specific frame of mind around health and families. That was completely foreign different to the way I was raised and what I was told to believe was better, right, etcetera. And so it took a lot of time of living in that and listening to really come to appreciate why people may have a belief or value system that they do and how important it is to the decisions that they make. It really takes time. And so to come back from an experience like the Peace Corps where you are living and working in a community in a totally different culture, you feel very fulfilled and inspired by what you're doing every day, you're with like minded vocational individuals, to then go back into the classroom for 4 years was brutal. And and to go back into a system where frankly some of my peers were interested in making the most money and becoming the most successful as quickly as possible, And that felt very contradictory to the real life experience that I had just had, and and that didn't feel in alignment with my values. And I think what a lot of people in my generation are learning is that the world's much wider than that, and our skill set is actually very useful to a variety of different settings and and we're gonna be pulled in different directions and that's wonderful. I think I had sold myself a justification that I had to live this certain way and I had to stay within a certain scope. And it was only when I started reaching out to other mentors and really thinking about what I'm passionate about in life and what was still missing that I then pursued opportunities that unraveled into something much bigger and much more beautiful than I could have imagined.

In the emergency room, something comes in, it's immediate. So you and your entire team have to rally around creating coordinated action immediately. There is no time to wait, to adjust, to discuss things. You have to be able to rely on a team that can snap into action and that you are all aligned in how you're going to conduct that. And that's a very specific skill set. You train for years to be able to be in those high, emotional and stressful settings and deliver reliably in high quality way every single time. That's repetition. That's that's a specific type of leadership to keep people calm and focused. Sometimes people need to be given a task. They want to be told, first, we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do this, this, then this is gonna happen. Long term is completely different. You're playing the long game, which usually involves community members, building support, building trust, empowering people that are 1 day gonna be completely taking this over as their own. So that process is very different. It's much more relational. It's much more dependent. You have time to discuss, to step back, to adapt, to rethink, to adjust, and I I believe if you're a good leader, you're doing that constantly. So they are very different skill sets, but I do think that 1 complements the other because both require high emotional intelligence, have to be able to read your team and read the situation, and both require excellent communication. You have to become a master at communication. And news flash, none of us are. We all make mistakes every single day with communication, but it's a commitment to constantly looking at how could I have communicated this better, what did I need to do differently, and then putting that into action. So the cruel reality of this world is that there are gonna be people who end up suffering an incredible amount and potentially dying from something that in another country simply because of where you were born, you don't have to suffer. And that sense of inequality or injustice is 1 of the driving factors for me. I have no delusions that suffering shouldn't exist or that suddenly we're gonna have a world where inequality doesn't exist. But I chose that I wanted my life to be a testament to saying, I see you, and I'm gonna try. You deserve something different. You deserve to know that, and I need to be able to get to the end of my life knowing that I spent my life in that fight. I couldn't see that and then walk away from that for me. For me, it's impossible to micromanage because the program is too big. When I say big, I'm saying 30 countries, 200 different project sites, thousands of employees at the same time over years, and that is growing exponentially every year. So it relies upon a system whereby you trust and they trust that there's a communication system, that you're clear on the objectives, and the other really big thing for me is that the team that you're working with on the ground is invited to ask as many questions as they want. We take for granted perhaps that we're in a culture in America where it's pretty common to raise your hand and ask a question. There are a lot of cultures that I've worked in where that is not a reflex. You don't ask questions. You receive information and you dutifully do what you're supposed to do. And so it's creating a culture where you invite questions. Questions are safe. Questions are welcome, and and that's a whole process. But for me, I don't need to micromanage if I know my team on the ground is open with asking questions, asking for resources, asking for clarification. Now success, that's a complicated indicator because what could be success to 1 person is not success to another. This specific role that I'm in now has to do with capacity building, so giving people a new technical skill that they don't currently have. So yes, I have a way of figuring out. If think of it like learning a language. You would be able to assess pretty quickly if someone had learned English to a reasonable level or not. Right? Because it's a new language. So I have those very black and white indicators of this person has this skill or doesn't, but is it positively impacting patient care? That's very different and that's harder to measure and and usually dependent on a variety of things completely outside of our control. 1 of the most challenging things I find with emergency medicine work is you can have 1 of the worst days of your life. You have a horrible death that you may feel personally responsible for, you have to go to work the next day. You have to go right back into that exact same room and scenario that was your place of trauma. So the turnaround on that is incredibly quick. We have to establish very good ground practices, and it's usually a daily practice of how we're gonna move through that. I have to learn and be self aware enough and do all the self work outside of work to be able to show up in a way that my team can look at me and say this person demonstrates resilience and an ability to work through things and adapt in a quick way that feels healthy, safe, supported. So I would almost say being able to foster that within the team means you have to be doing a lot of that work yourself. People really couldn't wrap their mind around the type of suffering that you're seeing globally, COVID or not. What was unique about New York and that first wave of the pandemic is that we didn't know the enemy that we were fighting. We were doing our best guess, and every single day, we'd find out, oops, that thing that you've been giving to everyone was probably not the best idea and then you'd feel guilty. Oh no, did I do something wrong? So it was this constantly moving target where you felt like you didn't know the enemy. It wasn't revealing itself and it was constantly changing. And the second thing that was unique is I was working with a team that didn't have the global health experience that I did and maybe had never been in a situation like that of feeling completely overwhelmed and completely beyond resources. So usually when you're talking about global health or humanitarian work you're also talking about low resource settings. Meaning you're never gonna have what you're supposed to have or need to do an ideal job. You have to understand the need on the ground. It's nuanced, and it's different. Just about every place you go there are specific factors that are going to change things and so 1 of the most important things for for me and for my team is doing a really really good needs assessment and feeling like we have the most information that we can to truly understand the situation on the ground so that we can clarify our objectives because our job is really almost as a consultant. This is the morbidity and mortality in your hospital project site. This is what you'd like to improve, and then we have to go about figuring out how we're gonna do that. If you don't have a strong needs assessment, you're lost. And the second thing that's super important is local leader involvement from day 1. There is no way that I am ever going to know the needs in a project site in a country where I've never lived as well as somebody who that is their lived experience. Their knowledge is essential in this process and their creativity is essential. They've also typically become extremely resilient from being in that environment and resilience breeds curiosity and creativity. It's a requirement of how to get through the day, and so involving local leaders, local staff, community members, whatever's at your disposal from day 1 is key. You also absolutely need them if you're going to scale. You are not physically going to be able to do it with your small team, so you have to very quickly create a local network of empowered knowledgeable people who are gonna help you achieve that goal, and it has to be a common goal. They have to feel that this is a need of theirs that needs to be fulfilled. If it's not, it's not gonna be successful. I think very few of us are naturally born with the innate gifts and knowledge to know how to work through intense trauma and crisis situations. So the first thing I would say is that I needed I needed help. I needed to get professional help and insight from a variety of different modalities to find what worked best for me. And now that's a variety of different things. Biking home from my shift and being able to vocalize, really getting it out that I was upset about something or yeah, honor myself, be excited that I made something go really really well. Breathwork is really beautiful for that. Voice journaling, that's something I've been doing for over a decade. I finish a tough shift, I turn on the recorder, and I talk it out because once it's out of me that releases it, that shares it with the world and for me that's an important part of the the process. And then being able to work with a professional on my intense game, shame, remorse, feelings of inadequacy, and really where does that story come from. What actually happened? How can we reframe this so that you have not only the confidence, but the the capacity to go back in tomorrow and to be able to show up in a reliable, high quality way. So it's it's a whole package of things that I need to do and after a really tough shift or a really difficult death, that may be my almost full time for 36 hours. I never underestimate the power of taking 30 seconds and just doing a super intentional breath for me. Other people want to do it with me, great, but that single moment grounds me to be able then take the situation with as much grace and as much clarity as I can especially before I do a very critical procedure which is a could be a life threatening or life saving procedure, that single breath is so key to me. So it doesn't have to be a long drawn out scenario. It can be actually something quite immediate and that's the beauty of breath. We can do it anywhere, and we're all doing it all the time.
