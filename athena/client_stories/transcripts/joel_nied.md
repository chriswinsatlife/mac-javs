Hey, Joel. Can you do 1 clap, please? Clap? Yep. I love your plates. No. You got it. Yeah. You gotta you gotta sink. I get it. Exactly. You know, I consider myself an entrepreneur with no risk appetite. We're repeat that question. If you want us, can you lean forward? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Pull this down. Okay. Good. There you go. And then lean back. Is the person I'm thinking of assigning a task to have the experience necessary for the task? Hi. My name is Joel Mead. I'm a corporate and securities attorney, and I help people form, grow, and buy and sell companies. That is in a nutshell, you know, what I do for a living. But, you know, ultimately, the the objective is to help clients, you know, obtain their goals, whatever they are. The reason that I went into law in the first place is because I I found it, intellectually challenging and stimulating, but also because it's a I found it a great way to help people. And while I, like the notion of entrepreneurism, entrepreneurialism, I think the best way to describe me and my attitude towards helping people that are trying to accomplish business goals is that I'm a entrepreneur with no appetite for risk. There there's sort of 2 elements to leadership. You know, where you draw the line between leadership and management, I'm not sure. 1 is setting goals that maybe reach goals and and leading people to achieve it. And the other is helping your team grow. And and that is I think an important part of leadership. People often style leadership in how am I going to achieve a certain goal? How am I going to gain prominence for myself? But I think leadership really is how do you, confer, responsibility, power, and growth among, the people that you're working with and working under or or who are working under you. Well, the core team is always there. Right? So and the core team is often just a couple of people. There there sort of a, a paradox and that the core team is 1 that may not necessarily have, you know, the the most formal education or or be, the the most senior person, but the person you rely on the most for certain tasks and responsibilities that are essential to keeping the job going from from day to day. When you expand the team, you know, it it often takes something that I call, sort of situational oversight, where you're working with people that often have incredible expertise and you've worked with them on a specific task before and you know you can sort of assign them what needs to be done and they can run with it. In other cases, you're dealing with people that don't have a tremendous amount of experience with a specific type of project, or don't have a lot of experience at all. And you need to manage, both, expectations. You know, you have to figure out, you know, what tasks to delegate to whom, you know, all based on a variety of factors. So delegation, you know, these days, you know, compared to 10 years ago, has a lot of different variables. You know, some are good, some are bad, but you have to take them into consideration. You know, even before the pandemic, the ability to to pull in people to work on a project, you know, wasn't limited by geography. I think a great example of that is I had a project for a client in New York that dealt with company in Louisiana. And I was referred to the client by someone in Florida. The best person to be my right hand person on the deal was an associate based in Richmond, who I had actually never met in person but had worked on before and knew they were a good fit for the deal. And we ended up with about, about 8 to 10 people, within the firm working on the deal and then vendors outside the deal that we worked closely with in addition to coordinating all these different aspects in different regions. And it turned out really well. We ultimately had a traditional closing dinner, which you don't have often these days because people just aren't located in the area, geographically in the same area. For a lot of us, it was the first time we met each other. But because we managed the process, because the you know, I thought we were thoughtful in the in the delegation and and the feedback that we sort of pushed everyone to give each other, it worked out great. And it and it was a great resolution. I can only satisfy the sort of the excitement I get from watching people build things or buy or sell things they've built or or or wanna own by by working with a lot of smart, you know, interesting people who who, you know, have have great plans and wanna execute them, and I wanna help execute them. When I first started practicing law, did litigation because that that seemed interesting. But what I realized pretty quickly was that, nobody was happy, with with litigation with the exception of maybe the lawyers, because when you you lost in litigation, obviously, that was not not good. But even when you won, it it it was a exhausting process, both economically and emotionally for people that are involved even when you're dealing dealing with strictly, you know, business, you know, issues and and contract issues. And so after a couple years, I started practicing commercial transaction mergers and acquisitions work because in part I found that everyone was happy. You had a buyer who was excited to buy an asset or business, and you had a seller who was excited to sell and walk away with money and the satisfaction of building something and selling it. I think in order to be successful in business, have to have the interest and ability and sort of the fortitude to risk things. You can risk your reputation, money, time. All those things are at risk. And, having, people like me, or or me in particular, involved is that I can I'm a counterbalance to that. So so sometimes people wanna get out in front of their skis. I can often caution on that. But I also appreciate, the the elements, of risk and the role it plays in in being successful. You can't be successful without it. It's very important. But sometimes risk mitigation, and avoidance is is crucial, and it often takes a, objective third party, to identify those items. At least point them out and at least assess let people assess the risk if they're not seeing it themselves. Trust is, an essential element of delegation and and leadership in general. I talked before about how I don't have an appetite for risk, but you have to have a certain degree of appetite for risk whenever you are delegating and leading. Because I think the only way you can establish trust is to is to make an initial assumption, you know, after doing your your research, that the person you're you're giving work to, can do the work. And confidence that, that they will ask you if they need feedback and that you're gonna be available to give, the feedback. So the the best way to build trust is just to assume, that the trust exists when you start the relationship. As a young associate in a big firm, you are often not the recipient of, of delegation but dumping. The difference is is someone wants to get something off of their desk and off of their plate. That's dangerous. You know? And, you know, sort of learn that on the receiving end of of dumping that that you know, learn 2 things about delegation. 1 is that delegation is not getting rid of work and pushing on someone else. It's conferring responsibility, power, and resources so that people can accomplish their goals. That is a learning process. It's nothing you read. It's something you have to, you experience. It's to the benefit of the mentor. And I know that may sound a little self serving, but, you know, what you want is subordinates or people you're handing tasks to to be not only good at what they do, but but eager and comfortable in asking for guidance, advice, feedback, whether it's something very technical or or something that, you know, is is a broader issue in in their careers or or in a project. And so mentorship is essential. And mentorship can be formal or informal. Frankly, I'm more a fan of the the informal 1. But I think it's the job of people that are delegating tasks to act as a mentor, whether they're assigned a protege or whether it's just someone that is, you know, that they're working with on a short term or long term basis to to be a mentor because that's essential at the end of the day to improving productivity and and outcomes. I've learned by example. And I think that's the way most people learn about delegation, which is again another great reason to be a great mentor. So I definitely have experienced all sorts. And I think it's important to do that. Because I think, as I mentioned, you know, 1 of the 1 of the important aspects to managing projects and managing people and delegation is this sort of selective oversight. And I've had people that are probably not in cognizant of the fact that they are really just letting you run with something. They probably think they're dumping, but you happen to know what you're doing and so you can accomplish it. And then I've had people that are eager to get feedback from from me when I was being assigned a task and and have an open door. And that, I think, is is the best type of of of oversight and mentorship to have. Often, you know, we talk about sort of teams assigned to projects and, of course, we've got our internal team, but inevitably there are people outside our organization who become part of the of the team, which means you're in a delicate situation where you have a client that may assign, people in in their organization to work with you. And, sometimes they're working very closely and sometimes it's, sort of just providing certain information or certain tasks. And so it is a, tightrope, often you have to walk, of doing the type of delegation tasks and mentorship and oversight, but with someone else's employee. The same principles apply, but there's often, you know, potentially a little more diplomacy or or tiptoeing involved. And you just have to navigate that, but it's essential. It's the same issue. You know, if you don't get discrete assignments out to someone else's employee, can have the same problems you have if you don't do that internally. If you don't have that level of trust with someone outside the organization, it's the same problem. So it's really the same issues, and I think it's often something people overlook because they assume, hey, it's not my responsibility. All I need to do is ask this person in this other organization to do x and I expect to get it back by a certain time period. It doesn't work. You need to apply the same principles. How I keep my team inspired depends on what motivates them. I think it's very difficult to impose a motivation on someone. You have to figure out what motivates them and and frankly cater to them. And I know that may sound strange. It's counter to some people's management or leadership style where they I'm gonna tell them how they're motivated or I don't really care how they're motivated. Here's the motivational system that we're gonna put in place. You really have to figure out. And you have you have to get to know the people on your team and figure out what motivates them. You know, sometimes it is working extra hours because they think that'll lead to greater compensation. Sometimes it's the challenge. Sometimes it's learning something new. You really have to look at what they want and what they're interested in and that's how you keep people motivated. It's important that the deal structure doesn't get too far down the road before getting the attorney involved, often because there's just sort of large issues that we can identify pretty quickly that can either save the client money, you know, often through the structuring it so that you get the most tax event beneficial treatment. 2, you know, other risk mitigation issues. And as the deal progresses from an idea, to a letter of intent or term sheet, at that point internally, we start fleshing out the scope of the deal, how many moving parts there are. You know, is it just a simple acquisition? Is there financing involved? How many employees are involved? Are there regulatory issues? And once you start getting that information, internally, we start pulling together our team. How many people are we gonna need? Are we gonna need subject matter experts? Is there litigation involved? And we'll have to pull in litigators. All of these things start to coalesce until we get to the point where we're getting down to the point of drafting documents. And at that point, the the team is pretty much assembled. Some people we know we're not gonna need immediately. Other people, we just have a few, questions to ask and they've got some very discrete tasks. And then there's the core group which is gonna work on everything from from reviewing the documents, the due diligence, dealing with questions from the clients, interacting with opposing counsel, any other specialists that are involved, any vendors outside of our firm. And and then, you know, things roll. And to to some degree sometimes people need to be on call as issues inevitably come up. And then it all culminates in the closing where where it's sort of an all hands on deck, know, pretty dynamic situation which gets exciting and then ultimately it closes and and we all celebrate. Historically, was a closing dinner. Now not so much, but we all get to go home and get a little sleep. The biggest piece of advice is to I know this sounds sort of esoteric, but try to have out of body experiences. Try to look at what you're doing and what other people are doing as if you were observing yourself. I I think that's really important. People often either are just unaware of it or they think what they're doing is right. And the notion of self improvement is is crucial. And that that spans your entire career and entire life. I was just talking to a client recently who was incredibly successful, sort of had the, sort of arc of of a career that I think everyone would be any entrepreneur would be envious of. And I was sort of surprised, that he told me that he was he was, you know, watching and and reading these sort of, you know, what I think would often be, you know, seen as sort of the self help activities that that you would expect from someone who was just getting out of college. Still doing it. And and I found that, you know, inspirational, but also just a reminder that you're constantly growing. And not only that, you've got to help other people grow. I think that's important.
