## Transcript

I'm Jody Gearing, and I'm a franchise owner of more than 60 Five Guys locations. My most important leadership core value is trust.

I grew up in an entrepreneurial family, and I had a a father who was a owned his own landscaping company. My mother was in decorative retail gifts. So nights and weekends growing up was all about the family businesses and how we could support those. I always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I admired my parents for their ability to own their own schedules, make their own money, and it was something that that I always wanted to do. The question really was, what was that going to be for me? And as I started my career, I knew I wanted to build a skill set that would enable me to be an entrepreneur down the road, whatever fate would take me, whatever direction life would take me, and that's ultimately what I did. Trust is the most fundamental thing you can have in any partnership. Greg and I are completely different people. Personality wise, the way that we think about running the business, the way that we manage teams, and so having a business partner who's also your best friend has been for us an incredibly powerful part of what's made Hyde Park Ventures successful over time. Hyde Park Ventures has become a management company. We own and operate a variety of different types of businesses. Our 5 Guys portfolio of 60 restaurants across 7 states is our largest investment. We also have invested and run a company called Smith Mechanical, also based out of Boston, Massachusetts. And we've also invested in a variety of real estate assets, software, and a variety of public investments as well. Early on in my career when I didn't delegate was largely because I couldn't delegate. You know, the trash had to be taken out. The basic accounting had to be done. Right? The opening of the restaurants and confirming checklists were done was just fundamental to running a small business. But in order to scale the organization, we had to rely on delegation. And a couple of times I can remember back to, that time when I I couldn't delegate. You know, 1 of the things that that happened was burnout, was frustration across the team, you know, lack of trust of certain people that were trying to step up to help. And so being able to learn to delegate, as you scale and think about scaling your organization, is is key to success. Success. When you can step away from the day to day and you can delegate what is not that important and somebody else can pick up that slack, it allows you such mental clarity and freedom to be able to focus on growth of the business. And the growth and success of our company relies on that time that I and my me and my business partner are able to spend thinking about growth, thinking about strategic goals we're looking to hit, and finding ways we can continue to challenge our own team in their own growth in their careers. When you don't delegate, there is a ton of stress. The concept of micromanagement is overwhelming. And so the way to beat micromanagement is to delegate. And you wanna do that through empowering your teams, trusting your teams. This concept of trust as it relates to delegation are intertwined. Right? You cannot delegate without trust as the foundation of any relationship across the company, professional or personal. Once we were a super efficient business that was that became good at delegating, we saw such increased efficiency across the company. We saw an increase in morale. People were happier. We saw a change in company culture. We saw growth of individuals that we didn't expect, and ultimately, we saw the results and outcomes that the business was striving for. So delegation has so many fundamental impacts to our business that we see and we can attest to. And every day, as we get to the office, we think about what are the things that I can do, or rather, what are the things I have to do, and what are the things that I can empower my team to do to drive us to the next level? When you empower your team, you are showing them you trust them to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business. And every time we do that, we see a happier employee, a smiling employee, an eager employee. And most important, we see new ideas come to the business. And when we have new ideas, I mean, not all ideas come from me or my business partner. Ideas about ways to fix the business or fix issues within the business, grow the business, engage with our customers better, market to new customers better, lots of those ideas come from our teams. And so the more that we can delegate the authority to think through objectives, focus on outcomes, the smarter a business we're gonna be. You know, I think early on, you know, I felt my leadership was a little bit micromanaging, to be honest with you. And I wanted and felt like I had to have control over the entire business. And that wasn't healthy for me. That wasn't healthy for the business. But 1 of the things, again, you have to be able to do is find the right people, trust the right people, and empower them to make the decisions that you would make. And I think helping others figure out how to delegate themselves is an incredibly important part of the delegation journey at scale. Now I I love and try the best I can to lead by example. What would what would I do in any situation and and hope and coach that the teams around are observing some of these traits? And that's was an incredibly important part as being a leader is is leading from the front. 1 of the most fun things I do when I especially when I travel is I bring a red shirt and bring a red hat. And a red t shirt and a red hat means you're a crew member in the 5 Guys uniform framework. And, at any given time, I will throw that t shirt on. I will throw that red hat on. I will hop over to the cashier. I will jump on the line. I will participate in mopping down the restaurant. I become energized at working with our local store teams. So whether it's in North Andover, Massachusetts, Boulder, Colorado, or Bangor, Maine, being able to get on the line, enjoy working with our teams, leading from the front, not necessarily just with strategy and goals alignment, but with, you know, building that rapport with with the local teams is where I find energy, where it's really exciting for me, and 1 of the things I I really enjoy about, being a business leader. You know, 1 of the things that delegation has allowed me to do is to join the Navy Reserve, which has been something I've wanted to do since I was little. I grew up in a family of veterans. And so being able to build an organization and delegate and trust and empower the team to deliver results while I'm away, which can be up for a few weeks a year, is is critical. When I am doing something, you know, for the country, for the Navy, and not having to worry about the team delivering on results, making decisions on their own, empowering their own teams, to treat the customer exactly the way that we want to, that makes me so happy and fundamentally allows me to do something I'm passionate about, which is serving in the Navy Reserve.

Collaboration is so fundamental to the way that I think about running the business, think about delegating the business. 1 thing that comes to mind is the power of sharing your vision and aligning goals. And what comes to mind for me is a process that we go through every year that is our annual planning and budgeting. And every year, I set out the goals and objectives for the business. Where do we wanna be? What is the culture that we wanna sustain? And we have the team come back with their draft of what the plan should look like. And I don't set out. I don't write the plan. I don't I'm not involved in the PowerPoint slide. What I'm involved in is setting that that vision and sharing that vision for where we wanna go as a company and allowing the team to come back with their thoughts, their frameworks, their approach, and really through that empowerment is where we see ultimately growth year over year. So that 20 25 planning looks like this at any given time. Our director of operations who runs operations for the company takes point. He spends and aggregates feedback from all the different organizations within the company, whether it be people or administration or marketing or facilities, who are all individually setting their own goals. What do they wanna achieve based on the vision that is set at the top of the business? And the way that manifests itself is through a very thoughtful, very well organized, very clear strategy deck. A strategy deck that we go through as partners, and we set and approve those goals for the following year. It's a deck that we share with our team. Right? Our leadership team. It's our teams that we share all the way down through our general managers at the store level so that they're aligned with our shared vision and our goals. We share it with even the crew, and we've got different ways in which we communicate from the executive team down to the crew, and that communication piece is key. This deck sets the tone for the business for the year. It's a living document that we refer back to throughout the year. It all comes together into what we wanna be as a business every year. And so that part of collaboration across the business, up and down the organization, is really where we're empowered, really where we're motivated, and really where we find strength to continue to build the business year over year.

Brand consistency is 1 of the most important things in franchising. Right? You have to have the same experience in Kansas City that you have in Colorado that you have in Rhode Island. And so, as an entrepreneur with 60 restaurants, I'm not available to open the door to 60 restaurants or turn on the fryers or prepare meals. And so our ability to delegate all the way down the organization to the team members that do that is really important. You know, we delegate virtually everything around the customer experience. Right? If there's a customer incident, yep, something doesn't go well, we put bacon on a on a on a burger that shouldn't have bacon, we empower our teams to fix it. You fix it quickly, and you make sure the customer leaves with a smile. Right? I can't enforce that, you know, at the top of the business, but my teams on the ground do it. They do a great job because they know very clearly what the expectation is and what the culture is of 5 Guys and also of Hyde Park, and that's fundamentally to take care of our customer first. They make all the decisions at the store level, and they know they're empowered to do that because it's part of the vision and the culture we've established at Hyde Park. You have to be able to balance the strategic nature of the job as an entrepreneur and executive with fundamentally understanding what the challenges are at the restaurant level itself. So you have to find that split between being in the restaurant, right? Not every day, but sometimes. Going into restaurants that may be really good at something and not so good at something else, and understanding and coming up with creative ways to try to resolve that. Because if it's happening in 1 restaurant, it's likely happening in many. So to operate at scale, you need to figure out how to problem solve. The only way to figure out how to do that is to be present at the stores that may be struggling in some area. And so that mix and that split of your time needs to be really thoughtful thoughtful and really impactful. And at the end of the day, that's gonna depend on how big your restaurant group is, you know, the support of your teams, the way that you receive feedback up and down the organization. But make sure you carve out enough time to spend with the teams, but also make sure, of course, you have the appropriate time to think through the vision. Because when you're thinking through the vision of the business and the strategy and the goals, you're creating an opportunity for the rest of the business and the rest of the people in your business to be able to step up and grow their own careers. Because at the end of the day, we find most people wanna do that.

You know, I get asked a lot about frameworks and how do I think about delegation. And the 1 thing that I go back to is what's called the Eisenhower matrix. And it was what General Eisenhower used during World War II as a way to think through the problems that he needed to solve and the problems that he expected others to solve. And it's a matrix based on urgency and importance. Right? So in the high importance, high urgency, that's really where I spend my time during the day. Right? That's that's the highest impact. That's where I think I could be the most effective. The opposite, the nonimportant and nonurgent, I'd probably question why there's even a box for that. Right? That's probably not I guess the question is, do we even focus on that? And I really delegate the urgent stuff that's not as important or or it doesn't fit necessarily my skill set. And that's really where I focus my team on. And what are those? What can you do about it? How can we be creative? What have we not done? What have we not tested? And really empowering them to go figure that out. So if you work through something like an Eisenhower matrix, there's I'm sure there's plenty out there to use and to think about. I think you're gonna use that you're gonna have that as a really solid tool to help you think through how prioritize and how to delegate. Building trust is something that you have to do over time. You know, whenever I hire a new employee, you always start small. You build trust the the the slow way, the the thoughtful way. And as soon as they that person starts to prove that you can trust them, the more you give them. And the more you give them, the more leverage you can get. And the more leverage you can get allows you to focus on the more important things or things that only you, rather, are able to drive forward for the business. Once you have trust with an employee, you can push past the, you know, employee employer vibe. 1 of my my favorite things is we start every Tuesday morning executive call talking about the sporting event the night before, likely Monday night football, and if the Patriots are better than the Commanders, that are better than the Bears. And so that type of culture is able to be front and center in our executive team calls every week because we know we can have that banter, and then we can move right on to the necessary needs of the business right after that, fully trusting that everyone has been thinking through what they're gonna say, be thoughtful about how they've operated that previous week, and are excited about producing and showing off the results they've achieved. You know, the energy that's created from these conversations about football teams and and Monday Night Football is really energizing. And not just to me, I I know, but to my partner, to the executive team, and that that's that's pervasive across the company. And we try to have a light, fun, environment because we're able to set expectations up front, we're able to establish trust, we're able to make sure we have the frameworks to deliver the results. But having that ability to have a little fun while you're at work and have a little fun banner, I think is really important in company culture. You know, the advice I'd give myself years ago as a young entrepreneur about delegation would be to start small and build trust gradually. Right? Make sure you work your way into building that trust. Don't just go right into it and trust everybody for everything. Trust is something that's that's earned. But once it's earned, it's incredibly powerful, and it's a great source of leverage. Focus on, outcomes. Right? The key is the outcome, not necessarily the method. So tell your team what the expectation of the outcome is and power them to go figure out how to do it. Do the best you can to recognize micromanagement. Yep. Micromanagement is something that, you know, inherently is easy to fall into. Set goals and set expectations up front. When you set expectations up front, it's a heck of a lot easier to achieve the goals you're looking to with a team if they know what to expect up front. And the final thing about learning to trust, learning to delegate is letting go of perfectionism. As they say, perfect is the opposite of good. In an organization that's growing, that's scaling, you know, if you wanna be perfect, probably not the business of being an entrepreneur.

I never knew where this journey was going to take me. We went through, over the course of the last 7 years, building the business that we have today, not without tons of risk, not without tons of disappointment, tons of defeat, very close cuts on financings that had fallen apart that were barely able to to get through, through acquisitions that almost fell apart because a bid came in the last minute. And so what I would tell my younger self is stick with it. There will be ups. There will be downs. It's all how you manage your emotions. It's all how you continue to motivate your teams through challenges like COVID, challenges like failed acquisitions, challenges like big expenses that came through that we weren't anticipating and we had to manage through with our investors and our banks. Stick with it. Continue to think big. Continue to stick to the vision you have. No goal is too big, but if as long as you are focused, as long as you put the right team around you, as long as you set clear, concise goals, expectations, and you have the team in place that you trust to deliver on that, you're gonna be golden.
