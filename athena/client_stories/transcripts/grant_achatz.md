## Transcript

My ambition was to become the best chef owning the best restaurant in the world. And I was brash and thought I knew everything about everything until I got sick. My biggest concern at that point was not life or death. My biggest concern was not being able to cook. But it made me a better chef because of the trust, because of the delegation, and having people understand that is really what makes us special. My name is Grant Achatz, and I'm the chef and fellow owner of the Alien A Group in Chicago. Having 300 employees is really important to understand your role as a leader. And that is identifying the people, their personalities, and their desire to do a multitude of tasks that unify into 1 common objective. And with that, you have to dominate. So I was about 15 when I realized that I wanted to become a chef and really elevate what the dining experience should be. So more of an emotional, artistic, kind of really, a dialogue, essentially, between me and and the guests. The first time I had a dish that I really felt was an expression of the chef that involved a lot of emotion was at the French Laundry. Ultimately, I ended up working there years later, but there was a dish called Oysters and Pearls, and it involved a cider caviar and wealthy oysters and tapioca pudding. The humor of the name oysters and pearls, pearls found in oysters, and the fact that there was a tapioca pudding, which is normally dessert. So now in my head, the chef is turning everything upside down and doing it in a funny way. And to me, that was that really resonated.

At the French Laundry, there was probably 9 of us. And we worked 15 hours a day side by side, So you got to know them, and you would be able to do the dance as we called it. There was a lot of nonverbal communication. There was people helping each other out, and you would just move like this, like ballerinas. Right? And when you were hit that pocket, when you had that groove, you could accomplish anything. And that was when I had that epiphany moment. I just realized that there was no ceiling to what we could accomplish. The Alenia Group has 5 restaurants, and they're all very, very different in their personality, their food, and their energy. And that was obviously by intent. But within that umbrella of our 5 restaurants, there has to be some consistencies, and there has to be a level of standard that everybody is executing at. So as a chef, as the owner, when I go into all of the different outlets, I have to understand that amongst the 300 people that we have in our company, they're all wildly different. And that depends on age, upbringing, and experience. Right? So as the leader of that team, you really have to understand how to manipulate people in a rude way, right, to to have the output be what everybody wants. And that's a bit of psychology, that's a bit of friendship, that's a bit of mentorship, a little bit of fear and intimidation. And if you can understand those elements and apply them to the individual, both the team member and the restaurant, that's when you see results. I like to say sometimes that the Millennium Group is somewhat self selecting for people that are coming in. We have everybody come in for 2 days and observe. And at the end of that, I tell them, I sit them down, I look right at them, and I'm like, you don't wanna work here. You don't know it yet, but you don't wanna work here. And everybody's sort of dumbfounded. Right? And the reason I do that is because it is so specific, and it is very, very hard. A lot of restaurant groups and chefs, they don't have that lofty role that they're trying to hit. So they work, you know, a little bit less hard. And then if they come back, if they accept the position, then we hold them to that. I I like to think that the trust is people that are very observant and watch us move and understand the language, but also they have to have that little spark in them. And it's our job to find that and make it a flame and make it an inferno. Right? And so with that, there's a lot of failure. We allow people to fail, but then come back to them and be like, that was a decision that you made. We stand behind it. Maybe it could have been a little bit better, and here's how. And, again, those motivated people, they they take that information and they run with it. So trust for me was was something that I really struggled with when I was younger. So we opened the window. I was only 30 years old. And I was brash and thought I knew everything about everything. And as a chef, our egos are such that normally we're very territorial. And we have projects every day that are ours, and we don't let anybody else touch them. And for the longest time, that's how I operated, until I got sick, until I got diagnosed with with tongue cancer. And literally my ability to taste was it just vanished. So at that point I had no choice. And the roles flipped. So as the chef, normally I would sign off on everything. I would have a stamp of approval. And once I wasn't able to do that, I had to trust people. And within that trust circle, people were there for different reasons. All of them are really talented. All of them are incredibly dedicated. But they had to have a really good understanding of the language. My language, the restaurants, every language, everything about the standards and the way we achieve them, those are the people that I let in. Honestly, it's pretty it was pretty rare. That circle was pretty small. But now after we have a sister restaurant and a bar and another bar and another restaurant, you realize that it can't be just you. Right? It has to be everyone. So your job now becomes not the highest performer. Your job is the highest leader, the highest performing leader. And that's a whole different skill set. And something that as we get bigger, I realize that we have to reinvest in the people and mentor. And that's the way you achieve now. It's not just me. I was only 33 years old when I got diagnosed with stage 4 tongue cancer. And I knew nothing about cancer. I didn't know there was 4 stages. And my biggest concern at that point was not life or death. It was stage 4. So it was very, very advanced. My biggest concern was not being able to cook and not being able to taste. That was number 1 priority for me. And when that taste vanished for about a year and a half, I was scared. You know? They had saved my life. That was obviously a very important thing. But to me, I was a bit lost. And I had to figure out if I was gonna be able to continue with my passion without that core ability to my job. And I just put my head down and said, is where I'm comfortable. This is where I feel safe and creative and passionate. So whether I can evaluate the food on flavor alone, now is irrelevant. And I have to find other ways. I have to be creative with the creative. Luckily for me, a year and a half later, it came back. And what I realized is everything I learned about managing people, about engendering the spirit, about reprogramming myself to be a good chef when everybody in the world probably thought I was done because how can a painter paint without vision? But it made me a better chef because of the trust, because of the delegation, because of the sensory experience. So it was a very powerful event in my life in so many ways.

I think a lot of people say when something like that is removed, the other ones are accentuated, right, to make up for it. But for me, I'm not so sure that was the case in the front of my mind. I realized how important it was to have that interaction, that dialogue between digestion and the food. When for the when we opened the Linea, opening night, we had a specific force where a guest had to eat a bite of food that was elevated over the table surface. There was a pretty old woman in the restaurant at night that had that first, and I was nervous because it was very, very different than the way most people have eaten their whole life. And maybe I thought somebody would be a little bit embarrassed by interacting with us in that way. She laughed, and she laughed aloud. And I remember the captain in that room coming downstairs into the kitchen saying, Chef, she's cracking up. And at that moment, was like, this goes beyond putting food in our stomach. This goes beyond satiation. This is is our this is participatory theater. This can move people in ways that dinner alone just can't. And then it was like rocket fuel. Everything at that point was seasoned, if you will, with emotion. In the same way that you would salt, pepper, and vinegar, we would complete the dish knowing it would taste good, and then we would apply the aesthetic in the guest interaction with that. Everybody on the team is creative in their own way, and it also makes them happy. So it's really important for them to participate in that process. And everybody is comfortable doing it in different ways. Some people are more overt. Some people go home and write it out and email it to me because they're intimidated to talk in front of a bunch of people. You just have to understand the strong suit of each individual. Is there a personality if you really have to draw stuff out of them, or if you just leave them alone. Don't even give them the task, the challenge, I'll say. Let them do it for a month. See what they come up with unless they come to you for help. I just there's certain people that I know, their process is a little bit slower than others. But you have to provide them an opportunity to be successful as an individual.

The day before we opened the restaurant, I pulled everyone on the team into the kitchen, and I gave a speech. Now many of these people I didn't even know. I had met them during the interview process, and that was it. And I said, we're all about to open the best restaurant in the country. And if you don't wanna participate in that, you should leave now. And all of these people were staring at me like I I have 4 heads. Right? I looked at that time like I was 17 years old. But I looked at the room, and I looked in everybody's eyes. And there was probably only 1 person that was, like, visibly checked out. I have a very strict rule about timeliness. And everybody had to show up in the dining room at 4 on the nose. We were in the pre service meeting on day 2, and he showed up at 04:03. And I stopped the meeting, and I said I can't remember his name, but I said, you know, what time does your watch have on it? Because I saw a watch on his hand. And he goes, 03:59. And I go, you're lying. Let me see your watch. So they finally walked up to me and showed me. It was, like, 5 after. And that was it. I sent home in front of everyone and said, you're done. And then I told the team. I'm like, look. This is not malicious. This is the pursuit of perfection. And you can either be on board or you can go elsewhere. After that moment, I realized that we were going to be okay. Opening night of millennia, we had the food from The New York Times, the food from Laura Mae, the food from The Chicago Tribune, somebody from Fast Company, somebody from Wired. Now for the opening night of a restaurant, that is the pressure cooker for most people. Pre service meeting, I told everyone, this is it. This is what we've been talking about, and this is what we're gonna do. And it was like a manifestation. And we clicked. Everybody rose to the occasion, and it was just a massive victory. Since that first week of opening millennia and as time progressed, everybody right under me adopted all of my values and my philosophy for creativity and execution. So now they're the ones that make sure everybody's on time. And when you look back at that as the leader, that is almost better in terms of an accomplishment than making food float or reinventing fine dining. Because now you realize the impression that you're putting on people not only for their profession, but their personal life. You're changing people's lives for the better, hopefully. When I was young, criticism was hard. You know, it felt very visceral. It felt like somebody was attacking me. But now I look at it much differently, and I assume that's just with maturity and experience. I literally told the team the other day we had a email come in that was pretty harsh. And after reading it to the entire team aloud, we talked about it. And I said, a lot of what this person put in this email is simply invalid or untrue. And I said, but that doesn't change the fact that that is how they felt. And we have a responsibility to make sure that they feel good. That's what that's a big part of our job. So take some of this with your inner self, but understand that this person felt that way, felt compelled to write a complaint email. So how do we learn from that? I think delegation is assigning tasks to individuals that you trust, you want to learn either that process or the or the big picture, and drive them through the mistakes. You know, we have a we have a philosophy where there's no bad decision. If somebody's empowered, where they feel confident to solve a problem, it's almost irrelevant whether they were right or wrong. Because those people that you have that are willing to make decisions, that decision making is more important than the outcome. Because those are the people that are gonna learn and make a better decision next time. Leadership is not a sentence. It's not a paragraph. It's probably not even a book long answer because leadership is constantly changing. You have to understand the players on the field, the objective in that moment, who the audience is, and you're the the glue. You're the top decision maker that is testing out all of the problems or the projects. Be patient and trust the process. I think the way that I delegate and help the team accomplish our goals has changed a lot. It used to be with aggression intensity, And now it's more nurturing and personal. I remember my business partner was like, we have to be friends if we're gonna be business partners. And that thought was pretty repulsive to me. Business is business. Everything else is that. And it wasn't until about 5 years ago I realized how important that was. And you have to be careful when you tread that. But people need to know who you are, and you really need to know who people are in order to get the most out of them and in order for them to feel fulfilled and part of it. So that is what's really changed. Getting to know the people, understand, being empathetic with what they're going through, and honestly, really remembering what it was like to be them. We're 20 years into millennia. I just turned 50. So now you have to shift gears a little bit. And in order to really have that legacy, the proteges have to be out there, and they have to be really successful. So while obviously I want to provide them personal and professional growth opportunities, selfishly, it will be nice when they shatter all over the world and continuing what I started.
