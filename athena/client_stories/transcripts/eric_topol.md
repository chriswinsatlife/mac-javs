## Transcript

It was very clear that what we're all we were doing before we had AI was hoarding and storing data. We couldn't appropriately analyze it. And so the AI opportunity at first was, oh, well, now we have the tools with machine learning and the burgeoning AI models to be able to work with that data, not just on an individual level, but at scale with, you know, large populations of people. So AI was a necessary step to be able to move forward with trying to do better for health because each of us are unique. And so to recognize that, you have to be able to understand and analyze all the different layers of any person's data, which is what we're really starting to get to now. Hello, I'm Doctor. Eric Topol. I'm a founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute here at Scripps Research in La Jolla. And I feel very lucky to be here because it's a place that is hyper innovation, that we get to do things I could never do in prior points in my career. We have a transdisciplinary force. We have people that I can delegate to that I love working with. They're fun. We've got great chemistry and we're doing things that are big things to change the future of medicine. I have an incredible assistant now, the best 1 I've had in, oh, I don't know, decades. So I'm really lucky and that's so important. She anticipates things. I don't know how, she's like a mind reader, you know. I'm fortunate to be able to delegate much of the daily tasks to get help from, you know, others. Whether it's from the IT group or whether it's from, you know, other people that are administrative support. You know, just wrote a new book called Super Agers and it has almost 2,000 references. I I could never have pulled those together had it not been for Michelle who helps me. So, you know, I have certain people that I can delegate things that I could never do that together we come up with a product that's really, hopefully, meaningful, really worthwhile.

Well, I learned about the principles of delegation, fortunately, long before I got here. So I was at Cleveland Clinic for about 15 years. And when I got there, I basically had to build the whole heart center cardiovascular department. It wasn't considered great at that time. There was a very strong cardiac surgery department, but cardiology is our efforts are not surgery to keep people away from surgery if possible. So that was an interesting task because what I had to do is recruit a lot of cardiologists and get each section as I basically laid it out to have incredible people that were autonomous, that were high energy, fun to work with, you know, good chemistry. That was the most important thing I could do is to find other people who I could work with, that I could use the things that I'm good at, find things that they're really good at, and have this synergy that is, you know, 2 plus 2 equals 10. It's a flywheel effect when you have this ability to delegate to trusted individuals who are talented, find their talents, inspire them, have them work on their own. And that's what I did here. Basically, get a person to head up genomics, get a person to head up digital, later to get a person to head up AI, get a person to head up what we call the digital trial center that is doing clinical trials without medical centers. Working through people's smartphone and apps to do medical research, is something we're really proud of that we originated at this Scripps Research Institute. Each thing that we would do would require leadership that's not me, but someone to really look after that program pretty much autonomously. And that just gave this multiplicative capability to build an institute that's been very successful. Well back in late 2006 when I came here, the mission was to have the first human genetics, human genomics institute in San Diego. Genetics is kind of the family history. You know, I got my blue eyes from my mother kind of thing. Genomics is the letters of the genome. The 4 different letters that make up the genome. We have 3,000,000,000 of those letters in each of our cells. San Diego is rich with life science expertise in medicine, lots of different life science institutes here. Scripps is the largest biomedical research institute in the country. What happened within weeks of arrival was, oh, we're not gonna just do genomics. We're gonna do digital. So already we had the 2 big building blocks and the first digital program in the country. There were already other human genomics institutes in the country, but we were the first to have this kind of dual pathway of effort. Here in San Diego when I first arrived. And this is back in 2007. And what was interesting is I was at a conference not far from here that was organized by Qualcomm, which is a big wireless company. And they were having a conference about where is new technology going. And most of the people were kinda it's late in the afternoon and kinda sleepy. And this guy get up and said there's gonna be a smartphone with a camera in it. And it's gonna be connected to the Internet. And these people are saying, well, why do we need that? We have these pocket cameras that are point and click that are great. Why would you want a camera on a smartphone? And I'm thinking, woah, this is really big for medicine. And so again, this was really the beginning of a digital era of medicine where we could use the phone to collect not just photos, but also, you know, electrocardiogram and all sorts of medical information. For years, we were getting more and more data on any given person. So not just what would be in their electronic health record, but what if we had a genome with all those billions of letters of their sequence? And what if we had sensors like heart rate and heart rhythm and glucose and all these other sensors that we have continuous data which actually makes the genome look, like a small stuff. And then you start adding on medical images like scans, and lab tests, environment. You have all these different layers of data. That doesn't even include things like the gut microbiome, which is really important. So when you start having all this data on it, on just 1 person, big data for 1 individual, you start to realize there's no human being that could integrate, process all that data. We need help. We need to lean on machines.

Already today, people can go to ChatGPT or these other AI models and get a first opinion. No less a second and a third opinion. So that's already out there and it's just going to keep getting better. We're going to see a lot more patient empowerment because of access, this democratization of information that everyone can get to, not just the information, but the analytical tools. So I've already had patients that put in, they came to see me, they put in all their data and either themself or or a relative and they had a misdiagnosis or no diagnosis. And they came to see me because they went to chat GPT and they got the right diagnosis and they say, now what do I do? So it's already happening right now. Medicine is human bond. It's when you're sick that you know this doctor, nurses, that they care about you. There's no machine that's gonna care about you. They have your back, that you can trust, that you can turn to, that have a real human presence and touch. They're gonna do a physical exam on you of the things that are your concern and listen to you, which is not something we do enough. So that's what's so great about AI is it does other things that humans can't do, but what we can do so much distinct from machines is be human. And that's what people want when they're sick. I mean, being sick, particularly with a serious illness, is a very lonely, threatening, you know, horrific thing to go through. And you're not gonna get comfort from an AI. You're not gonna feel that the AI is gonna come to the rescue. It may help in the initial stages of helping to make a diagnosis, fine. But that human human bond is what is the essence of medicine. And we can't ever forget that. I'm inspired by, you know, innovative ideas and then trying to get the people I work with electrified about galvanize about the potential of if we could do this. It don't do little stuff, you know, go for big things. Each person can have talents that they actually weren't even in touch with to use to achieve a goal that's bigger than they ever envisioned for themselves. It's extraordinary transformational impact. So, you know, for me, it's just whether it's as a coach, if you wanna think of it, idea person, but it should get get others as excited as I get about an idea. Now it may fall apart. It may be a fast fail. But among those ideas and opportunities that are big, there are gonna be some that are worth chasing after and doing whatever it takes to get the evidence, to get the implementation, to change medicine and make it better.
