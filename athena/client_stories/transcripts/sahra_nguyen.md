## Transcript

In 2016, I was living in New York City as a freelancer working journalism and documentary filmmaking. So I've always had a strong passion for telling stories about communities that were underrepresented. My parents are refugees from Vietnam. They escaped the country on a boat like many other boat refugees after the Vietnam War ended in 1975. They had nothing, like literally nothing. They didn't know how to speak English. They didn't know how to navigate these systems. Being an entrepreneur with a heart for advocacy has taught me that it's not just about what's best for me, but really it's what's best for everyone around me. I'm Sarin Nguyen. I'm the founder and CEO of Nguyen Coffee Supply. I actually fluctuate between Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen all the time, but for the sake of the company, we actually educate people with Nguyen. I know that Nguyen is very popular, but within the company, we actually educate with Nguyen because we feel like calling out the phonetics of the n helps you go remember the name Nguyen.

As a freelancer in New York City, I spent a lot of time in coffee shops because our apartments are tiny so pretty much the coffee shop became an extension of my home. Now around 2016, I noticed that Vietnamese iced coffee was becoming really trendy in coffee shops. However, every time I'd order the Viennese iced coffee, it was never real Vietnamese coffee beans and I would ask the barista what's in this Viennese iced coffee and they'd say, oh, it's our house Colombian cold brew or house espresso from Brazil. We add Sphinx condensed milk to it. So this was kind of like the initial light bulb moment where I was like, okay, there's this growing interest in this cultural concept of Bemis iced coffee, but there was no real product in market. So after a little bit of a Google rabbit hole, I learned that Vietnam is the second largest coffee producer in the world. As a Vietnamese American, I was mind blown that I had never known this fact. Right? And a lot of people are actually not aware that Vietnam is such a major global contributor to a coffee experience. And so in 2016, I went back to Vietnam, and I was visiting my family. Most of my family, my relatives still live in Vietnam. And I conducted our very first sourcing trip and we established our first direct trade farm relationship. And so the next couple of years, I was kind of just doing like research and I decided learning about the coffee industry while still freelancing full time. By 2018, I was getting pretty close to launching the business, we had just imported our first pallet of coffee beans, I learned how to roast coffee in Brooklyn, you know, order the first bags and merch and t shirts and then by the 2018, we launched our first bags of coffee on a website and that's how Nguyen Cough Supply was born. So in the beginning when I was first starting to build Nguyen Cough Supply, I was with someone, my boyfriend, now husband, and in the beginning, like, we did everything ourselves. I mean, like, I didn't fundraise for the company, so it was self funded, it was super scrappy startup, and we did everything together and I'm so lucky to have found such an amazing supportive partner as my now husband because he was so down to do everything with me. So like he would come to the roasting with me every week, I would roast and he'd help me pack, we would do pop ups together in New York City and he was he was always there helping me like lug all the boxes, the wagons, like the carts, like setting everything up like whatever I needed, he was down to do with me, right? And so in the beginning, he was my first source of support, my first unpaid source of support like doing everything with me, anything I needed and and then over the years eventually, he got in payroll, you know, we got health insurance, but he played every role from helping me pack bags, helping me do orders, and then eventually we transitioned to like a automatic roasting machine called the Loring, so I developed the profiles that he'd helped roast, so he started roasting coffee for us, packing, and his background is in 3 d design and art, and then we started layering in graphic design, content, video. He started flexing his creativity with the company, and now he's our full time creative director. I'm so grateful that he was always down to help and support but then there were times where I had to delegate or ask him to do something, maybe it came out a little bossy because my communication style wasn't the most effective, right? And in the beginning I was really blurring a lot of the lines of like how I would talk to him as my partner versus how I would talk to him as an employee of the company and I found that in a lot of ways I wasn't really being fair to him because I was blurring the lines and I was talking to him as my partner which sometimes can be a little bit more direct and harsh, right, because you have that foundation. And so over the years I've really had to work on kind of like filtering my feedback and delegation towards him of like, would I say this to anyone else in the company in this style, right? And so there was definitely a learning curve for us working together around how do we like show up in a professional context versus in a personal context. In the beginning when I was beginning to delegate more things to him like roasting coffee, that was a big thing that I let go because I used to roast all of our coffee. For sure having the foundation of trust between us as partners made it so much easier for me to offload more responsibilities to him because I knew that he would have my back, in personal and in work. So definitely having that foundation of trust really helped me offload more and helped me allow him to take up more responsibilities in the company.

I grew up with a lot of confusion and shame as a young person, not really understanding what made my family and culture really unique. And then when my parents would, you know, come, you know, to school to pick me up or like to meet with my teachers, I just saw really quickly that they weren't like other parents. They dressed differently, they looked really different, they didn't speak English. And so for me, growing up in Boston in the late eighties and nineties, I mean, was pre social media, right, where I didn't see anyone who looked like me on TV, on CDs, in magazines. There was really a big turning point for me though where I shifted from like, coming from this place of shame to a place of pride, and that for me happened in high school. So when I was a sophomore in high school, I joined a youth activist organization in Boston called the Coalition for Asian Pacific American Youth housed at the Ethnic Studies Program on the UMass Boston campus. So this was the very beginning of my exposure to ethnic studies, to the civil rights movement, to the black power movement, to activism community organizing. This was around the time where I felt like I was becoming conscious. Right? At this time, they called it critical consciousness. I felt like I was beginning to gain the tools in the historical context to understand like all the social and political forces that brought my parents to America. And so for that reason, I no longer felt ashamed of my parents, but I actually felt very proud of what they had gone through as refugees. So there are 2 main coffee species called Arabica and Robusta. Robusta beans have double the caffeine content of Arabica, so more energy. Robusta beans also has 60% less fats and sugars than Arabica, so the flavor profile is really bold and rich and dark chocolatey and nutty. It's kind of like if you think about red wine and white wine. Right? Red grapes and green grapes, just 2 different species. Now the dominant coffee bean in America is the Arabica species. The dominant coffee bean within the third wave specialty movement is the Arabica species. When I learned that Vietnam is the second largest coffee producer in the world and yet no 1 recognized this fact, I felt like there was a really big injustice happening in the coffee industry that essentially rendered Vietnamese coffee and Vietnam's dominant bean, the robusta bean, invisible. Not only is Vietnam the second largest coffee producer in the world, Vietnam is the number 1 producer of Robusta. So in a lot of ways, Vietnamese coffee is synonymous with Robusta coffee. Right? But Robusta coffee, it's not a niche coffee species. It actually makes up over 40 of the total coffee production, right? And Robusta coffee is grown all across Asia, in Africa, and South America. So when we think about this larger issue of Robusta as a coffee species being exploited and being deemed inferior to the Arabic coffee species, this impacts Robusta growers worldwide. So for me, having a direct connection to Vietnam because of my family and my culture and heritage that naturally led us to being Robusta champions at Nguyen Coffee Supply. And I knew that by leaning into the fact that Vietnam is the number 1 producer of Robusta and if through this channel we could change the perception of Robusta and elevate Robusta as a species, this would have a worldwide ripple effect to improve the livelihoods of Robusta growers worldwide.

It's not easy changing the way the entire world thinks about something. When I first started the company, the stigma against Robusta was literally institutionalized through coffee companies and coffee education. And so entering an industry and completely challenging the status quo and challenging their conventional ideas is super hard. The challenge has from day 1 has been rewriting the narrative, shifting the global perception so we can then change the systems. Right? The great thing is 6 years into it now, we've definitely reached the tipping point. The tide is turning and anyone who does a little googling right now, you will see that Robusta is rising. It's the coolest thing because now like I'm really involved in industry events so like I'll go to like coffee conventions and coffee conferences and like now everyone is talking about Robusta or like how do we innovate in Robusta, how do we elevate Robusta and so it's it's really exciting right now to be at a point in our journey where Robusta is rising and the whole global community is really embracing this coffee species and the communities behind it. Building wind cost supply in general has been so hard because I had 0 experience coming into it. Right? Like, we're an importing and roasting company. Like, we're direct trade vertically integrated. Like, there's so many things that I learned about the industry coming from not knowing anything. But if I had a stack rank, the challenges, I would say that educating folks around our mission and speaking and connecting with audiences in a way that could expand the conversation to be inclusive of Robusta growing communities, I'd that has been the biggest challenge, right? Because the tactical things, even if I didn't know it, like, can learn right? You can Google it, you can learn it, you can do it, and that's something that, like, I have full control over, like, I can control whether or not I learn how to import and roast coffee, but I can't control what other people think and I can't control changing their minds, I can only do my best in trying to position the conversation and expand perspectives in a way that invites them into what we're doing and invites them to reconsider their biases and stigmas within the coffee industry and then hoping that together we can make a change. For me getting alignment is critical and in order to get alignment you need to over communicate, be really direct and and clear clear communication so that everybody understands the steps to success. So the advice I give to entrepreneurs to build trust within their systems is to be really clear and direct in your expectations of them and clarify the steps potentially to reach success so that they then know how to achieve that. Right? And if they can achieve that and they can follow through and execute and align their words with actions, then that fortifies trust over time. So once you decide to bring someone into the company, there's a baseline level of trust there. Right? Because you want the person to do well and be successful, and I believe trust is an important part of that equation. As a solo founder, I'm a big operator. I played every role in the company and I like to operate. I like to execute. However, over the years, I've really offloaded a lot of the day to day ops to my ops team which is now 3 soon to be 4 so that I can focus on more sales and strategy and recently I had found out from my ops director that like we're transitioning warehouses in California and in the past there'd be moments where I was like why didn't I know this like why wasn't I briefed like I sure everything is happening in the company when I was a little bit more attached to the to the responsibility and maybe because I didn't have enough trust and whether or not that was the right decision, but now this time when I heard that we were transitioning to a new warehouse I was like I kind of like that I had no clue that was happening because I trust you and I'm grateful that you took the initiative to see an opportunity to gain more efficiency and cut costs and you made this happen without even running it by me because that shows trust and competency, but also for me I felt very supported as a leader. So now I'm spending a lot of time thinking about, you know, what are the things that only I uniquely as a founder and CEO can do that will really move the needle for the company to expand the opportunities of growth for the company and everyone involved through through years 6 to 10. And as I think about what that responsibility is, anything that doesn't fit that vision, if it is not, then I have to find another way to offload and delegate it. When I first started working with my EA about a year and a half ago, it was pretty challenging. There was a really big learning curve for me around delegation and more so in around investing in our partnership. In the beginning, I struggled because I wasn't really investing enough time in a relationship and so I felt like my delegation was like at like a level 1 delegation where it was a lot of like ad hoc tasks like, oh like do this real quick, do this real quick, it's like handing things off and there were too many like recurring systems or projects that my EA could support me with, right? Now over the last year and a half though, like it's gone so much better as she's been able to understand and learn more things about my day to day work life and she's gone great actually at being super active and to be like, oh, I saw this in your inbox, or I noticed this in like your messages, like did you want me to help you with that, like can I support you with that, right? So she was doing a lot of like the proactive initiation that I was failing to do for the both of us and now we're about year end, like 1 of our goals this year is for her to become more integrated into the organization. So 1 of the first steps we started taking together at this year is to have her join all of my internal meetings which she previously wasn't doing, it was just 1 on 1 meetings with me and her, so now she's joining all of my internal meetings, she's taking notes in all the meetings and then she's kind of like filtering out any action items that need to happen after the meetings, it needs to be action items that other folks in the company need to action on and she'll just flow that into our project management tool, assign it, delegate, and then maybe anything that comes up that she could help with, it'll get flowed over to her, right? So this is kind of like a new level that we're exploring and really excited to see how it goes. You know, our vision is to build the most influential coffee company in the world, rooted in the world's largest source of robusta coffee. The largest coffee companies today are brands rooted in a Euro centric or North American context and these places don't grow coffee. So when I think about the future coffee for our company, but for the culture in general, the world deserves a global coffee brand of influence rooted in origin. I never expect to be everything to everyone. Right? So we just focus on what is unique about our coffee. That's the Robusta bean. What's unique about the Robusta bean. What's unique about the origin and culture of Vietnam, what's unique about our brew styles, right? And that and in that effort, we're just here to share and expand culture. And when I'm faced with challenges and doubt, I often, 1, think about the greater mission that we have ahead of us and I think about all of the opportunities that we can create for everyone in our ecosystem. And I try not to compare my struggles with my parents' struggles because everyone's struggles are different. But I am endlessly inspired by the resilience and the tenacity and the courage my parents had to escape Vietnam after the war ended in '75. Like that to me feels way scarier, harder than what I'm going through. And now my dad goes golfing, he's into AI, he's using ChatGPT, my mom has a YouTube cooking show, and when I think about the span of their life, what they've experienced from the war to now, it's just like anything is possible. You just gotta keep going.
