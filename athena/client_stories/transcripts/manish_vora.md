## Transcript

Every day I I wake up or I walk into any of our 6 locations, I'm like, can do this better. I want this script to change. I want this ice cream to be better. I want this wall to change. I want this. There's a never ending culture of change. But at the end of the day, they're the things that really matter and focusing that energy in on on those things. And and so I think many entrepreneurs get, you know, excited about the pivots that they took in their business, and there were many stories of companies that completely strategies and made millions of dollars. I mean, were certainly great products that came out of, like, full pivots, but good businesses that you believe in your purpose, your mission, and the product, ultimately, staying focused on it on that is is is really the thing. My name is Manish Bora. I am the CEO and cofounder of Museum of Ice Cream. And 1 of my core philosophies is that truly anything is popsicle. And that possibility within yourself, within within your team, within innovation and ideation is that truly when you think about your life as a kid and what was possible, did you ever dream that you could swim in a sea of sprinkles? Because ultimately that was the dream of anything as popsicle for this company is that my partner, Mariel, she imagined the Pacific Ocean as a sea of sprinkles. And guess what? Few years later, we have built a sprinkle pool that has, you know, seen 3,000,000 people and and kids are now dreaming of oceans and lakes and seas swimming pools of sprinkles. So anything is popsicle.

I never imagined that my business card would ever say museum of ice Cream, and in fact, my parents were probably mortified when I was standing on the top of the High Line and looking down on the space in the Meatpacking District right across from the Whitney Museum and told my parents that this is the next iteration of my art focused entrepreneurial career. My dad looked at me and for years he had been supportive and and had always encouraged us to take risks and and all the sacrifices that my Indian immigrant parents had made to to provide us all the opportunity for education and to to be an entrepreneur. And he said, isn't it time for you to go back to Wall Street? And that ping of there was a ping of self doubt in that moment. I acknowledged that, hey, this hasn't worked out the way that I thought it was going to be. But in my heart, I really believe that all the steps, all the failures, all the learning led to an insight that I think that we could uniquely have. While the pendulum has swung from the height of COVID where where, you know, everyone's thrive striving to be in, you know, fully remote distributed companies. I think that the world of, the hybrid workforce, the principles are still the same around building trust through connection, through the physical, through the vulnerability and sharing and just being human. The same principles of like what creates connection, it's participation, it's ritual, it's you opting in, it's you sharing, being willing to share, but at the end of the day, you have to choose people that go back to your core values that are willing and open to the idea of participating in this way to create trust.

Processing trust and delegation is maybe 1 of the hardest elements of being an entrepreneur, a manager, a leader, and even an employee. Right? It's letting go of things that somebody can do better or somebody needs to do has been ultimately a challenge and I think many entrepreneurs struggle including myself with this I can do this, I know this product in and out and I'm going to do it faster or better and also not being open to you know new ways of doing things and for me, it's been even a challenge as I've shifted from operating these units. I used to manage and open with my partners like you were on the ground for 2 years in a traveling circus, and that experience was invaluable. And I always say that whether it's in the trenches in technology or in hospitality, if you're not truly in every element of the product in the early days, you ultimately will never really own your product. And I see it. I see that formula is like super super critical. I would say that trust is there's no easy formula and it requires so much investment of time, culture and growth and the complexity of like not being in in in real life anymore. We used to be a traveling circus, then we moved and worked in an office in in in New York and had every employee working out of a single office. Now we're like the global distributed team working in an IRL business with even folks who are from all over the world who are who are coming in and how challenging that is. And at the same time, it's some of the things are so simple. When you realize it's the same formula of human connection, it's the same formula of trust. I think that so many entrepreneurs and managers, employees like feel trapped often within their own business, and I have felt that. I probably feel that every other month where I just feel totally engulfed and and stuck in the and which which not only makes you stuck in work, makes you stuck in your life. So I don't have any space in my in my brain, in my like physical body to do anything else outside of when I when I leave this space. And I think that, you know, I've learned as as, you know, moving beyond the initial hustle now to over 500 person, you know, global company that by letting go of certain responsibilities, by seeking support and tech and tools that are bringing high quality people with high quality processes, that it frees up space, first and foremost, for your life. And by freeing up space for your life, it frees up space for you to be a better employee and more and more innovative. And I think that what is so critical is you have to have trust, whether it's a a like a technology tool or a person that the tool of that process of being able to trust people to get things done is ultimately 1 of the biggest hurdles to letting go of that work. There's trust in the training, there's trust in the implementation of the process, and there's trust that comes backwards where really within our company people don't know if this person is sitting in Kansas or Philippines, they truly are part of the teams, but that also has to be a commitment from you as a culture of a company to say your team whether they're sitting in our museums in Singapore or in a remote office in in The Philippines or running our customer support for for our technology, ultimately the same principles and values. They're your team members. They're people. They're humans. I've definitely studied in the delegation element of is me doing this task going to add value or and or is it gonna detract from something else that I can be doing? So I think that 1 is the willingness for people to not do it at the level that you would expect because ultimately that empathy and understanding that I have been doing this business for for 8 years and to expect someone to walk in and do the same task within a month or 3 months or 6 months or read your mind, it's a constant reminder and I think I still have to remind myself where frustrated and I get impatient with the outcome instead of it's a step to learning, it's a step to learning, it's a step to to to for for more openness for you to focus on the energy and the things that your company and your team members need for you to to better the team. And whether that's tangible and physical, whether it's financial or tactical, or it's being a better cultural leader, a better supporter, it's a hard reminder, constantly working on it, constantly trying to, you know, catch myself as I as I have, I think, what is like inherent CEO and patience and a desire for something to be done exactly the way that I do it. And I would say my team members would would definitely say that it's not, I'm not perfect at it. I'm not perfect at responding in the way that I would with like the amount of integrity and and that a lot of that's also just developing more practices. 1 of my support team members, you know, introduced like us taking deep breaths before the call, that wasn't even me initiating that. Those are really great approaches to reminding us to slow down before we speed up. Everybody wants to move fast. Everybody ultimately in businesses like have to, at the end of the day, like move as we said to innovation, but I actually like don't mind the cliche of slow down if we're going fast. There's a balance around ideation and new ideas is that there is almost unlimited capacity for new ideas. And I would say for our culture, it's not a culture where ideas are not happening. Right? This is there's you know, creativity. It's a creative business where creative ideas are constantly being thrown out, but you have to balance ideas with execution and I think that that you can sometimes skew towards like too much too much in the way of ideas and not enough in the way of of execution because at the end of the day, the idea is not worth anything if you can't put it into place and it can't be communicated properly and put through the right processes and and and get through quickly, but the tools around your own body and breath work and yoga and meditation have been transformative for me and that work around stillness and taking breaks and Pomodoro and you know and and movement during the day, standing up and and also just making sure that we are going back to the old school, like get a whiteboard. I cannot live without a whiteboard in my room. I don't care if we're scribbling, we're talking, we're moving. Work way in the way that way that you need to work and that you best create and ideate. Creating the spaces and the environments, I believe, are extremely difficult for true creativity and innovation digitally in these digital meetings. So how can you bring the hybrid element of of of physical and in person, how how can you be open to, hey, you don't have to be sitting at your desk with a boring backdrop. You know, my my Slack and Zoom backdrop is a is our airplane cream liner and I'm constantly on an airplane or in the background of an exhibit. If I'm not in a museum, I'm digitally in the museum because just that spark of joy when I open a meeting and saying like, you know what? Like, I'm dressed in all pink. I have my pink sweater and I'm going to be with a cookie carousel in the background, and let's smile. Like, it's not that serious. And and that space for ideation creativity is like, you're you're you're not typically coming up with a great brilliant idea when you're in a dark hole and and miserable. So, like, first and foremost, like, start with your own personal happiness and joy to create that environment. And if I'm not bringing that as a leader and I'm not bringing that attitude, I know I'm not setting up an environment where people can be creative and and ideate. At the end of the day, I'm a physical business that takes a long time to build. It takes almost 2 years for us to build these museums. So what is cool and hip and and and and in vogue right now cannot be like a huge distraction to like is the product fundamentally good and it is not, I think that often people will ask us like how are you gonna change this? Is ice cream gonna go out of style? People have been eating ice cream for 100 years in mass volume and and is the most popular and most social media food in the world. This is not going to change. Ice cream might change. The toppings are gonna change. Even within the 8 years of doing this business using our ice cream examples is that when we started, people were like, people aren't gonna drink milk. Milk is out. We're it's you know, we're in almond milk, coconut milk. Where's the alternatives? I'm negative about ice cream because of, milk. I can't control those elements. I can control what I can control, which is the products built around joy and connection, and that to me is never gonna change.
