## Transcript

When I was 8 years old, I discovered the most beautiful thing in the universe, which everyone knows is spreadsheets. I had this gemstone collection whose entire purpose was to give me another row for my spreadsheets. I loved just massaging this dataset. And I think there's something of the idea of putting order onto chaos.

Hi. I'm Cassie Kosserkov, AI advisor and Google's former chief decision scientist. And when I think about delegation, I think a little as the recovering statistician that I am. There are so many tasks where you could have trust that the person has earned because you've been able to check how well they do the job. Sometimes we fail to do that, and it's our failure of vision and clarity of vision. Delegation begins with you knowing what you actually want, and that piece is an uncomfortable piece for leaders sometimes. It's a hard piece, but it is a piece where you have to say, this is what I am trying to achieve. How would I express that, and how would I check that? Once you get the hang of that, then delegation becomes so much easier. So not to make a pitch for the discipline of statistics and decision science, but really, it is that clarity of vision that's going to get you there.

So I grew up in a town where, in that in this suburb, everyone went from the same kindergarten to the same primary school, that's our elementary school, no middle school for us, same high school, same university. And so even this question of like, oh, hi new person, where are you from? We don't ask that. We know where you're from. You're from here. So that was how I grew up. And when I was 15, I went to the university and I started studying statistics there and economics. And in my second year, the professor said something that hit me strangely. He said, and MIT, the second best school for economics in the world. And I I was like, woah, there's a ranking? There's different ones? There's best ones? What? And so I put my hand up and I was like, what's the first best? And his answer was University of Chicago, and I got obsessed with the idea that I want to go to the first best school in economics. So University of Chicago started me out, and I was very lucky that I picked the majors that I did. Statistics I picked because I thought it was going be my easy a. I'd been playing with data my whole life. And economics for me just had this poetry of being the science of scarcity.

I believe that how our lives turn out, it's down to 2 things. What we can control and what we can't. And so what we can't control, call that chaos, call that luck. Nothing you can do about it, you don't see it coming. But what you can do something about is the quality of your decisions. I mean, that's the name for the common pattern in what that personal steering wheel is, what that control is. You know, what we don't talk about enough with data is that it will never cover reality. So the row in my little spreadsheet will never be the gemstone. There will always be something missing. But you can impose an order insofar as is useful to you and have something that has far better memory than you yourself. So I've always loved that about data, that the way in which we can make sense of things, we can impose order.

Any good tool that we choose to use allows us to be better than we were without it. Any good tool. Our memories are not that great. Pen and paper has better memories than us. If you're thinking about whether something's better than human, pen and paper's better than human. And of course, the spreadsheet's a little better than the pen and paper because if you've got a lot of phone numbers, let's say, that you're memorizing on pen and paper, you would have to go through all those unwieldy post its. In a better format, you can look up those phone numbers much faster. So there's your speed part, memory and speed. Scale, so many that you can deal with. You cannot load in 1000, 1000000 phone numbers into your head. Well, maybe you can, I can't? I won't prejudge. But a computer can deal with billions easily. If you think about, for example, what is the third app, third from the left and 3 down on your phone's home screen. Do you remember what that app icon is? See, if it was a life or death situation and you had to know that, you would remember. And you might, now that you've cheated and looked at your phone, probably keep that in mind. That's attention. But if you didn't know the answer before I asked you, it wasn't something important enough to pay attention to, clearly. And the thing is, you had taken a screenshot of your phone, a home screen, which is actually kind of a good thing in case you lose your phone and your backups and you might want to know what apps you had, so you have that screenshot. Forever, you can go back and see what was there in that third and third position. And so that's the advantage of data. Memory, attention, scale, and speed. Data is a tool for those things, and it's beautiful for that. What's much more important though is what we're going to do with it. Leaders, I'm going to make you a little bit uncomfortable. See, you used to be allowed to think slowly. And what I mean by this is when you wanted some information processed, you would have your data scientists or, you know, spreadsheet people do some operations on it slowly, following some formula. And it would take them some time. And while they did this, you had the time to think. And if you did it yourself, you would have to know how all the formulas work. And while you were plugging them in and checking each thing, you had this illusion that you were thinking hard about your problem. The hardest thinking is actually about what problem you want to solve and how you would know if you've solved it. Just like if I'm standing here and I want to go through that door over there and I've already decided it. The journey towards that door is now execution. The smart bit really was knowing what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. Now if that door is really far away, I'm not going to have to think very often. I can kind of zone out and meander. But what if I was teleported immediately to each destination? What if I lived in a world of effortless technology, where I could ask for anything and get a result back near instantly? Well, that is 1 hang of a spotlight then on me and my decision making skills and my leadership skills. Because now I have to think much faster.

And 1 of the huge ambiguous pursuits of life is leadership and decision making. Navigating an uncertain reality, saying what the criteria should be in the first place. Where are we trying to go? You can go anywhere at all. Where and why and how? Now, people might not expect that to be called an art, but it is. And so that will be the hardest thing to delegate, because that's a matter of responsibility. Someone has to bear the burden of the responsibility of those choices. There's also a burden in art. You have to bear the burden of having expressed this, not that. So those are the things that are going to be hardest to delegate, and you delegate them to those who have stake in the matter, in the project. You delegate them to people who have shown over time that they are competent, have integrity, benevolence, they care, and people who are senior enough to bear the burden. Because there is a big burden that you bear when you're dealing with situations with no right answer. So those are the hardest to delegate. The easiest to delegate are your right 1 right answer problems.

Decision intelligence is the discipline of turning information into better action, any scale, any setting. Which means it is where the human piece touches the digital, technological, mathematical, scientific piece. It is that intersection between the 2. Everything that we do, every tool that we use, can be used responsibly or irresponsibly, wisely or foolishly. Tools that scale us up can scale up the stupidity of our actions. They can scale up our intelligence. So having a discipline that looks at how to navigate complex systems, complex tools, but also works at the smaller level. So it's a discipline that says, well, if your problem is a very simple decision problem, you're choosing 1 of 4 panels in mid journey, how do you approach this? Sure, we can have that conversation. What we'd probably say is, is this a life or death situation? Maybe not, then just go with the 1 you like. When it becomes more important, when there's more on the line, because we always start with priorities and what we're trying to achieve here. How important is it? Then, if it's really important, there will be techniques to approach it more carefully, to align it more towards what you need. Decision intelligence is a groundbreaking idea in that it rewrites how we should approach technology, data, AI, all those disciplines. And that groundbreaking idea is not something that could have flourished with just 1 person shouting into the void. So I have everybody to thank who's been on this journey with me. So that's the the obvious answer. And then I'll just, know, make a give you a little choke answer, but I got here and you see me in this hair and makeup done by someone that I had never met before I got here. If I hadn't trusted and if I hadn't trusted that people would set up the lights nicely and the mics. This entire project just could not happen. Now, I could try and go and learn all the pieces myself, but it would take me forever and I would be bad at each little component. Component. Why? Because every moment the world moves forward, and every moment, each discipline, area of inquiry, endeavor task, gains something. Our technology gets a little better, our processes get a little better, and no 1 individual can hold all of that in their head.

When we think of AI as a technology for automation, so not the not the user side of things where, you know, someone has made you something like ChatGPT and you interact with it, rather the perspective of the builder of the large scale system. So what are we doing here? We're automating. We're automating with examples, not instructions. Why would somebody do that? So what's great about instructions? What's great about instructions is control. You know exactly what the system's gonna do at every step because you wrote down the instructions exactly. No surprises. And if it doesn't work, that's called a bug. It fails. You fix it, and then it works. So control is a lovely thing. You can debug that. You you know exactly what you're gonna get. What would possess you in your right mind to give up control? Why would you use data? Because understanding this, you understand the future. The reason is that you are giving up control to be able to solve problems that are too complicated to fit in your head. You're giving up control for complexity. That is the deal here. And it's a bit of a Faustian bargain. Because when you start to solve problems that have solutions that are so complicated that no human can wrap their head around them, you get amazing innovation, but it's going to demand more of us as leaders.
