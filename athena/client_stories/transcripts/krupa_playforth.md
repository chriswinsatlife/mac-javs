## Transcript

Parents worry all the time about what they can do to help protect their babies from illnesses. 1 option is to give your baby I think that for a lot of type A personalities, delegation is just hard. When I started my social media platform, part of what was really tricky was figuring out where the where the buck stopped, where I needed to be doing the work, whereas, you know, kind of delegating it to somebody else. And for 3 or 4 years, I was able to keep up myself. But as things leveled up and as I opened my own practice, it became clear that I needed to hire someone to help me. I'm Doctor. Krupa Playforth. I'm a pediatrician, a mom, and now a content creator on social media with a focus on providing educational content for parents that is practical and accessible. I grew up in Sub Saharan Africa in Malawi and have been in The US since I started college.

So when I first started my social media platform, the idea was to keep things small. I was just kinda seeing how things would go. And then over the past 4 years it has grown a lot. A couple years in I realized I needed to get some help. First I just hired a legal assistant who focused on doing my newsletter, managing my website, but a lot of my social media and content creation was still me. But then a couple years later when I opened my own pediatric practice it became clear I needed more support on the social media side, especially because that platform was taking off and was larger than I had sort of predicted that it was going to be. So I hired a team that was well recommended to see if they could take some of the burden of social media off from off my plate.

Initially, it went well, but ultimately, I realized that it wasn't working. And part of the reason was a lot of my social media is focused on trying to be as authentic as possible, as spontaneous as possible, and creating content based on what parents are asking about that week and what is going on in the world. So for example, when the pandemic hit, when right now when there's a flu outbreak, those are the concerns on parents' minds, and I like to be able to pivot and talk about exactly what's going on. With working with a team, especially a team that is working with other people, the trouble is they need a little bit more lead time to create content. And so what they wanted to do was create a social media content calendar that was 2 months ahead in the making. And that takes some of the spontaneity and the authenticity away because you can't preplan for what's gonna be on parents' minds in 2 months. We went back and forth trying to find a way to communicate for me to figure out how to balance what I needed from them with what they needed from me, and that did not work well. What I learned from that was that I need to be a little bit more precise in what my goal and my vision is for my platform, and then I need to be able to communicate that a little bit more effectively. And then on the other side, I probably also needed to learn how to let the people that I had hired, the people that I was delegating to do things their own way and trust that they actually had a vision as well. My assistant is also remote, but, she she spends a lot of time doing more practical things for me, so managing my website, managing my newsletter. Just this week, I got an email from her asking about our newsletter for this month, and she made a whole list of suggestions for topics based on her own experience as a parent. I think when I first started working with her, I wouldn't have been as comfortable trusting her to take on that more practical role. It's taken time to build a relationship.

Vision is an interesting thing because when you're an entrepreneur, you have an idea and then you try to implement that idea. I think the best way for me to forecast for changes is not to be too tied to details in the idea and to be willing to adjust the idea as things come up. From the practice standpoint, the obvious answer there is the practice is gonna grow. And figuring out how to manage that has been a challenge. This week, I decided to stop taking new people to the waitlist because the practice has a waitlist that is now 6 or 8 months long. Adding more people to the waitlist is only stressing me out, and it's taking away from my ability to focus on the patients that I have right now. You change as you become a leader and an entrepreneur. Allowing yourself that trust, that self trust allows you to build upon the idea in a way that maybe you didn't even picture. For social media, when I first started, this was going to be a mom blog. This was going to be just like a website with some articles. And now the way I would love to see it grow is to be a thought leader in the space, to be someone that does speaking engagements and does work to try to educate parents not just about pediatric health physical health issues, but also about pediatric mental health issues, which are becoming more and more of a concern as we move away from the pandemic. You know, I I stuck to doing the things that I thought were helpful and getting feedback from my audience about what they were finding helpful and then allowing that to direct the the traffic of where we were going. So for example, there are a lot of content creators out there, particularly physician content creators that create courses online to educate parents and to educate patients. And I have a lot of respect for that because that is a side gig that is generating income that gives you space. But for me, it felt wrong to gatekeep child health information from parents. And so 1 of my biggest visions for my social media platform is that I really wanna keep everything free. But keeping everything free means trying to create content and spending time without getting paid for it, which is why I then went down the path of taking on some brand collaborations, but again being judicious about which ones I'm doing. I think there are 3 key characteristics that make somebody an effective team leader. The first is that they have a vision. If you are the leader of the team, you need to know where the team needs to go. And whether that you're a CEO or a parent, you need to know what direction you want to take the entire group of people. The second characteristic is being approachable because things will come up, and when you have a team, you need to not be too scary. You need to be able to talk through problems without making people feel like they're inept or making them feel self conscious and nervous about bringing up things because inevitably there are gonna be obstacles on your pathway towards whatever vision you have. And then the third thing is effective delegation. If you are not somebody that effectively delegates, what happens is you end up trying to take on all the tasks yourself because you are the 1 with the vision. So you're the 1 who knows exactly how you want things to be. But recognizing how to delegate and finding the right team members to delegate to and creating a a culture of trust that goes in both directions is really important to be an effective leader. When I think about my social media platform, for example, graphic design and putting creating the content, coming up with the ideas for the content is easy. But putting that content down on paper in a way that is accessible and looks nice, that's not where my skill set lies. It was taking a lot longer and it was taking me away from the part of this vision that I really wanted to spend time on. And once I found team members that could do all that stuff easily and could do it better than I could, but were able to capture exactly what I wanted, that's when things really took off. If you want to expand your business, if you want to scale, you have to be willing to offload tasks that you are not good at. And you have to be someone that has the humility to recognize that you're not good at everything, and that's okay.

Professional growth as a physician involves being able to find the time to continue educating yourself. Very often in medicine, we think we know it all, and we really don't. And sometimes the patients really know more than you do, particularly about, a, their children, but also their children's conditions. I have some patients that have extremely rare genetic conditions, and those parents know more about those conditions than I do. And having the humility to sit down and just have a conversation with them and to learn, and then to take that knowledge and go back to the literature and see what else is out there and further my own knowledge, I think helps everybody. But I only have the space to do that now because I have a practice that is structured in a way that allows me to do that. And I'm not so burnt out that I just don't wanna think about work when I'm not at work. Once you become a certain size on social media, once you have a certain number of followers, you automatically attract trolls, you attract online attention that is intended to tear you down, and it's really easy to let that happen. What I have learned is for my own mental health, I need to block those people. I need to not tolerate any bullying or harassment, and I automatically just I don't worry about trying to reason with online bullies anymore. I just block them. They're not allowed on my platform because it's not good for me. It's not good for my audience. When I start to get distracted by metrics or focus on how many people did this post reach, then I automatically know that I need to take a week off of social media. And that's hard to do once you have a following and once people are expecting things like ask me anything Thursday. That's when I reach out to my assistant and ask them to help. My audience has been so understanding of this. And 1 of the pieces of authenticity that I try to bring is that I'm upfront about it. You know what? I'm burnt out. I'm starting to get distracted by this. I'm gonna take a week off. People are honest, but they're also they don't want the things that you think that they want. And this comes back to the practice as well. When I'm upfront about where my limitations are, people are a lot more understanding of that than you think that they're gonna be.

Anybody who is a professional or is somebody that has been ambitious over their lives and has an idea, sometimes what you can do is is hamper yourself because you think, oh, well, I don't have the skills for that. A lot of these skills can be learned or they can be delegated. You can find people to help you with the things you don't know how to do. When I first started social media, I did not have even an Instagram page, and I was at home during the pandemic with a child who was in virtual kindergarten, which was very stressful. And I talked to my sister who said, you've always wanted to do this. Just start an Instagram page. Just jump in. And I didn't want to, but I listened to her and be willing to be okay with things not being up to the quality that you would expect from yourself or the quality you're seeing in other people at first. Everything is a learning curve. And if you're willing to embrace that and to learn and to have the humility to ask people for help, you're more likely to succeed. I think learning from other people that have done it is also really, really important. Ask questions and listen to the answers, because people are a lot more generous about their sharing their experiences than you would think that they're gonna be. If you think, oh, that person's never gonna respond to me, so I'm not even gonna bother asking, you've already hampered yourself, and you never know. And finally, I think for parents in particular, a way to create balance because anything that is taking you away from your why is going to ultimately lead to burnout. If you can incorporate your why into what you're doing, it's a lot easier to keep doing it and to maintain the motivation. 1 thing that I've learned about delegation is that it takes a lot of humility. We think we can do it all ourselves, and we really can't. And it's impossible to have every skill that you need for a business to succeed. If you're someone that has some humility and you're willing to learn from others and also delegate tasks that you're not good at to other people that are good at them, you're more likely to have a business that succeeds.
