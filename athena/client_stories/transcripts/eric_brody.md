## Transcript

People don't change until they have to step into the abyss because their daily life is so uncomfortable that they need to change. So we step into the abyss, we start a venture fund, we have a podcast, and we're plugging away finding companies in tech and real estate and creating an ecosystem that's attacking the way in which you deal with real estate. But people came to me and they said, you a venture capitalist? I said, no. They said, you a podcast there? I said, no. But like, what are you? I don't know. Then the real deal, 1 of the largest real estate publication comes to me and said, you know, content is the new currency. Let's start doing some shows together. So we create some concepts on real estate construction and development, daily issues, talking about real estate. People come to me, do you work for the real deal now? Are you on TV? Are you just a content creator? I said no. So now all of these ideas are swirling. Why? Because when you're in a crisis, when you got rocked, when what you do as a developer gets taken from you, what are you gonna do? You keep moving your feet. This is Eric Brody from Annex Real Estate Partners. And if you wanna be a leader, you need to learn, you need to execute first. Never forget that. In order to lead, people have to find you to be credible. You have to be an expert and be trustworthy. How do you decide what you're gonna delegate, what you're gonna handle personally, and what you're gonna give to somebody else? Is there a universe where you can actually delegate most tasks to others so that you, the leader, are in the moment at the right time? That concept came from a book called On War by a guy named Carl von Clausewitz. You, the general, need to review what's happening in the field to make the appropriate decision. You need to delegate in order for others to do the redundant tasks so you can have all the brain power in the moment to execute at that time. Now, again, another concept of delegation. You are the leader. You are not the boss. You are not demanding. You are asking. You need the people below you to respect you and want to work as hard at the problem as you are. How do you do that? You do that with passion, you do that with empathy, and you do that with respect. So you want below you those that are looking to achieve the same goals and have the same mindset as you. Success happens when intuition meets innovation. There's probably 1000000 different things out there. But the number 1 thing that I think that always pushed me forward was not being comfortable with the position that I was in. So how do you make yourself uncomfortable each day? How do you thrive in the change? How do you have courage under fire? The only way to do that is to continue to push yourself on the daily level. The number 1 thing on being a leader is never allowing yourself to be comfortable, to constantly be learning, and to understand that you build respect with those around you because they find you to be credible. Credibility is expertise and trustworthiness. So continue to push yourself each day to continue to learn. And then within that learning, you will learn how to lead others. It doesn't have to be innate. And I don't think it was innate in me. I think it was a learned behavior. So, boom. You get into college and you realize, I didn't do that well. What are you going to do if you're not going to do that well in school? I'm going to be an entrepreneur. Alright. Well, how do you become an entrepreneur? There was a class at the small business administration that didn't even have anything to do with college that had to do with how to write a business plan. Because my perception was I was gonna be an entrepreneur because when you go through college with a 1 7, a 1 7, and then they're like, we're gonna kick you out unless you get a 2 0. Boom. You get the 2 0. You realize, you know what? Maybe it's best that you carve your own way in this universe. So I go to the small business administration. I learn how to write business plans. So I start banging them out because what you realize about business is just like Beethoven or Mozart, you don't create masterpieces, you become prolific and 1 of them will become a masterpiece. I realized I want to get in the gym business. Maybe there's money in the gym business. I underwrite the deal and I said the only money in the gym business if you own a chain of gyms. So now I get out of college and immediately I'm like, how am I gonna get into that business? Become a personal trainer. Why? Low barriers to entry. Boom. Become a personal trainer, get into the hottest gym or my perception and I even gonna shout them out or give them even a brand shout out today, I go to this gym. Work everything, sales, marketing, training, didn't matter. And I'm like, hey guys, give me a shot at being a gym. And they're like, no son, you're way too young. So I write a business plan for an independent gym. I go to that gym. I say, here's how I'm gonna make you money this year. He accepts it. I'm 21 years old. Right? All of a sudden, I'm working there. I'm making a money. At the end of the year, you owed me a bonus because I wrote the agreement. Right? How did I do that? Now you have chat GPT, but back in the day, you were reading these dummies book. You want to write employee agreements for dummies. So I read the book, write an agreement, he executes it, boom. Throws me up against the wall when he owns me a bonus, and he's like, you can go get your lawyer, I'm not giving you a dollar. And that's when I realized better to own the real estate than to own the gym because you know what you can do when you own the real estate? Put a gym into that space. So I start to look around as to what I want to be in that space and you find a mentor. So I had a couple mentors. 1, my father who was an architect who always told me, don't you dare design. You should be a builder developer. And then I thought about Steve Ross and all these titans of industry, I said, 1 day I want to build and develop like them. So how do you do it? When you take a look at the spectrum of real estate and development, you understand there's specific types of developers, and 1 of them right up my alley, leadership. Being able to execute complex projects over time. That to me was something that was fascinating, and that's called a builder developer. What I found is most people are concerned about the ability to construct. They don't want to get their hands dirty. They'd rather finance the deal, market the deal. So what I realized is wherever most people are running away from like a fire, that's where you run to. So I went back to construction school after college. I got I didn't even get a degree. I just was taking classes 4 nights a week from 6 to 9 about construction. Now I'm talking about straight construction. So if you look at the development life cycle, it's like an alphabet, a to z. Construction is a huge piece like e to u. You go to construction school, you learn about construction. So I'm taking code, zoning analysis, building materials and methods of construction, construction management. But how are you gonna make money at this time? So I'm going to school 4 nights a week, 6 to 9. My father, he's an architect. I said, dad, you can hire me. He goes, son, you don't design anything. What you can do is be my indentured servant. You can sit here and you can learn from me. You can go to the department of buildings, department of transportation, you can ask me questions about what you're learning, but unfortunately, you gotta figure out how to get paid. So now I'm working for my father for free from let's say 8AM to 6PM, go to construction school 6 to 09:00 at night, and then on the weekends, I started brokering. That was the way in which we made money. Now, start to do this information. You start to look into the market and what do you need? What do you need and what is most important to do your first deal? And it's not me who said this, it was Sam Zell. And that is find an inefficiency. Where is there an inefficiency? I didn't know what an inefficiency was, but I did know the zoning resolution, which is what is the density of a building you can build in any municipality? But I was in NYC. That's where I grew up in Brooklyn. So now I'm looking at deals. I see a 2 family house that's up for sale, but I see something different. I see an 8 unit development because the lot area compared to the 2 family house was much different than what they were selling. That was an inefficiency. Raised the capital, bought that bad boy, developed my first building in a neighborhood called Prospect Heights, and boom, that is the real estate journey. So I find an inefficiency on a lot in a neighborhood in Brooklyn called Prospect Heights, and I developed an 8 story building. Now I take that and I start marketing it like crazy because as you realize, people aren't gonna know about you unless you get the word out. So I start marketing. It leads to another project. I do 11 story building on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. It leads to another project. Eventually, 2,008 hits and if anyone remembers 2008, there was a crash in the real estate markets. This was tarp money, banks were going under left and right. And development is an investment game. You invest your capital for return. Okay? But you have to have revenue. So, I'm like, know what? I'm going to need to figure out how to pursue development but also have revenue. At that same time, I meet a general contractor who's running a mid market, mid level construction company. And I say, look, let's partner on this. Let's develop assets together. He teaches me the rest of the construction business that I didn't understand, and that was my day job. Became a general contractor. Open shop, we call it. That was in 02/1112. We wind up developing 218 unit buildings in Williamsburg, 21 story buildings on 96th Street, 457 Atlantic Avenue all over the city. It winds up being 40 buildings and 800 units. So now we're plugging along. I probably would have been a mid market developer in New York forever, not opening my eyes to the rest of the country because when you're from Brooklyn, the only thing you know is NYC. And if I could conquer NYC, I could conquer the universe. Well, lower my hole, that was not the way the future would go. Your perception of what you think the future will be does not mean that that's what happened. So out of nowhere, this little thing coming out of China called coronavirus hits. Boom. New York shuts down. Now, what happens in human nature when we're hit with a pandemic? We've only had a few throughout history. Well, many people pass away unfortunately. And when you look at urbanization, what happens to people? They run from cities. And I had just built a 21 story, 50 unit building on 96th Street. We opened the doors and guess what? No humans are around. Are you going to fold or are you going to innovate? So me and a partner of mine decided, let's innovate. Very random. My homeboy's like, yo, you got to get out of Brooklyn. Come hunting with me. So we go out there and I meet these special force operators and they teach me 2 things. Number 1, when you've lost everything or a pillar of who and what you are, it could be the greatest change. You just have to look at it from a different perspective and start to analyze those things within you that represent your shadow. What are you not willing to see? The other thing they said was, when we were in the military and we went out and our mission wasn't so successful, we did something called an after action report. What is an after action report? Dive into what went right and what went wrong. So now as you recall, I developed a 21 story building. 68,000,000 from a bank, raised 20,000,000 in equity, wiped out. Okay? So what went wrong? We started to do an analysis of that, and we found a data analytics website. What did that data say? What? Are you out of your mind? There's way too much product, not nearly enough demand in this area. You're gonna get rocked. I said to myself, what else don't I understand about real estate and technology's application to real estate? We hold right there. We research 9,000 tech companies to understand the universe and the paradigm of the tech space as its impact on real estate. And as a builder developer and an entrepreneur, what do I do? I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna start a venture capital fund. So the next thing I say is how can I make this application from the things that I learned within real estate and technology back to the real estate game? I really would like to help developers who got hurt just like I am. And they're saying survive until '25, but might be till '26. So this is apropos to this moment. So I said, you know what? I'll start a rescue capital fund. So now, I'm going to be on the finance side of the game. I'm going to invest into developers that need a little bit of capital to finish their projects. I go out to the dry powder in the market, the credit funds, the insurance companies, and I say to them, I got this great idea. Back me, invest in me, and I'm gonna invest into developers. So what are the principles that guide our decision making in mind specifically within the real estate space. So the first 1 in real estate which I think is like a cardinal rule, and I call it the hell yes rule. You are going to sacrifice a piece of yourself for every project, for every asset that you purchase. You are going to sacrifice a piece of yourself so you better be obsessed with whatever it is. Second is, do you have a vision? Do you have a vision that sets apart what you're gonna do to something versus someone else? If you don't have a vision and you don't have a trajectory, walk away. The third thing that I think is really important is something that this guy, Nicolai Machiavelli, wrote in this book called The Prince in the 16 hundreds, and that is the effective truth. We are in a game where we don't care if you can talk about it or you work really, really hard. You either execute or you don't. So Machiavelli had this saying is, and we've heard it before, don't judge a person by their words, judge them by their actions. But Machiavelli would say, the result of the actions. In this business, the real estate business, you either do or don't do. There's no halfway. There's no I worked really hard. You either executed and closed the deal or you did not.
