## Transcript

My name is Tim Urban. I'm a writer and also a procrastinator. How do I reconcile those 2 things? I didn't do it alone. The first thing I did after college is I went to LA to write movie scores. I wanted to write music. And as a side gig, I was tutoring students. And then, as often procrastinators do, they end up spending more time on the side thing because it's not the the stressful, you know, thing you're supposed to be doing. It's the, oh, I'm this is what I'm not supposed to be doing. So I ended up digging into the tutoring world and, started hiring tutors, then I, partnered with my old friend Andrew Finn, and suddenly we were doing this tutoring company together and it was great and we grew it, except it wasn't the thing I I moved to LA to do. While that was happening, I always had my mind on writing, you know, movie scores in my free time. I'm also writing a musical in my free time. And then I also started this other thing, which is a a blog. And blogging was kind of the third thing of those 3. I had a lot of fun doing it, and I started to get an audience. And I thought, you know, what would happen if I did go full time with writing? What, you know, what what would actually happen? Or just full time with anything, really. So talked with my business partner, Andrew, and we had built the tutoring company up to a level where we had a pretty nice sized staff and they were running a lot of the show. And we didn't really need both of us there anymore. So, you know, decided, okay. I think it's time. I think it's time for me to go full time on a creative pursuit for the first time in my life, which is, you know, what I wanted to do right after college. Finally kinda got the guts to go and do it around the age of 31. Yeah. You know, when I finally did, you know, stop having my hand in 3 different things and just went full focus on 1 thing, which in this case was writing. It was amazing because I felt like I was doing an a plus job at something. For the first time, half my brain wasn't focused on what should I be doing with my life. I could just say this is it. This is this is the right thing. At least for now, I have nothing else to think about. I can dig my heels into my current life and just give it my all. Really give it my all, and and that was great. I loved it. I, at this point, was dating my now wife, and she was watching up close. So she knew the whole kind of backstory and all the inner thoughts. And, you know, my my best friend Andrew, who was my business partner. I mean, 2 people knew knew my whole story, and they both, you know, genuinely wanted the best for me. It was nice to be able to, you know, people who had followed the whole story, to be able to run this idea off of them every step of the way. You know, okay. I'm naming the blog. Here's 10 possible names. You know, what do you think? Here's the first, you know, few posts that I wrote before I even post anything. You know, do we like these? You know, what what can be improved? My confidence in what I'm doing goes up if I can get some confirmation from some other people that I'm not crazy that I think this is a good idea. Every single thing I've ever put online, basically, has run through my wife's filter. She gets my exact kind of core inner voice. She gets the the tone I'm going for. She she understands, me really well. And so I think if it were someone else, they might say, oh, you know, you're cursing in these blog posts. You know, you shouldn't do that. People, she would never say that because she knows that's how I write. What she will say sometimes is, you know, you're not being your fun Tim here in this writing. You've you've gotten kinda serious and it's kinda sloggy here. And I I just trust her because I know she has the best interests in mind. And same with Andrew, and, you know, and then later brought on Alicia who's been a huge part of the company since. And, that was a long extensive hiring process to whittle, you know, hundreds and hundreds of people down to 1. And 1 of the critical criteria there was someone who just gets it. Someone who I I can send it to them, and their feedback is going to be right on point because they just get what I'm trying to do. Now this little kind of inner group grew to Alicia, my wife, Tandace, and Andrew. And of course then, know, sometimes I would send things to a wider group, but those 3, you know, is really enough. I think if all 3 of them agree with a decision or think a post is ready to go or think a topic is a good topic to pick for the next thing, that's that's that's plenty. You know, I don't think you need a huge group of people to confirm, you know, your choice on something. If you start going to more than that, you know, it's just gonna get it's gonna lose efficiency. So I think a a little tiny group of of trusted people is extremely valuable and and usually enough.

Delegation is, a practice, in trust. I mean, that that is what it is. It is, by definition, tied to trust. The more you trust someone, the more you can delegate, and the better it is to delegate to that person. If you don't trust someone, you you cannot delegate to them. And so first of all, just do I trust this person's character deep down? But then for me as a writer, I make content, and it's my voice, and it's it's very personalized to me. If I'm gonna trust someone to, to assess my writing, to offer, you know, potential feedback or comments or to suggest something, I have to trust that they their taste is just really lined up with mine, that they really get exactly what I'm trying to do. Part of that is just a personality type. The person we ended up hiring, Alicia, she was a fan of the blog. So that's first. That's that's important. It has to be, you know, someone who likes these articles. That's gonna filter for a bunch of the taste component right there. But, you know, we interviewed a lot of people who liked the blog, and a lot of them just didn't quite actually they weren't really on the same exact wavelength. You know, we were hiring, we actually went to great lengths to test for this particular thing. So 1 thing we did, for example, is I said, I'm putting a new pop up on the website. And when you open the site and, you you know, it's gonna pop up and try to get you to sign up for the email list. And that's the exact kind of thing that I need to be on brand. It has to fit with the personality of the site. So I made, you know, 6 sample pop ups with the text that was in it. You know, 1 was just a classic, you know, hi, join this many readers and sign up for the email list. Like, you'll never miss a miss a a post. Right? That's for sure not something I would put on the site. And then there were ones that were closer, but just kinda like a little too weird, a little too often. Then there was 1 that was exactly how I would say it. And I just said, you know, what do you think of these 6? You know, do do any of them work? Do all of them work? You know, what do you like the most? And Alicia was 1 of the group of people, of applicants who just nailed it and said, definitely not. No. Almost, but no. And then, yes. That 1 sounds right. And I was like, okay. Someone who just immediately kinda gets that, that says so much. If you can get that right, then everything becomes so much easier because now, suddenly, you just that that little voice in your head that you makes you not wanna delegate things just calms down and says, no. No. Anything I can give to Alicia, I will give to Alicia. And and and, you know, the goal is I wanna be spending my minutes, every single minute, on things that only I can do. That's the goal. Every minute I'm spending on something that someone else could do is now a minute of the important stuff that that only I can do is now not happening. I think it's kind of a classic amateur error to do too much and to and to think I have to be doing this. If you want it done right done right, you have to do it yourself. You know, either you you haven't delegated enough or you've just haven't hired very well. You know, I would say my most important leadership value comes down to a certain way of reasoning, which is called reasoning from first principles. So we all have 2 ways we come up with our plans, our conclusions, our beliefs, our strategies, our art, whatever it is. And 1 is we take the formula that's already being done out in world and we make our own version of it. So we essentially copy, but, you know, we put our own flair to it. But we're doing something that's already in a category. So again, that can be, you know, you're making music that sounds like all the music that's on today or you're gonna build your company with the kind of same strategy and marketing type things that all the other competitors are doing. And then there's reasoning from first principles, which is a physics term where you take the actual axioms and you don't you ignore all everything else. You throw away conventional wisdom and you say, what what do my actual observations about the world today? If I use those as puzzle pieces and I puzzle together a conclusion or a belief or a strategy, what does it look like? Reasoning from first principles is an art of, you know, you're you're kind of like a scientist, you're experimenting, and you're going to fail a lot. You're going to make a ton of mistakes. You're going to put yourself out there. It's much like kind of riskier it feels. But when you nail something, you're going to, you know, disrupt your industry or you're going to, you know, become an icon in, you know, in creative world. People can succeed and make great careers reasoning by analogy, understanding the game that's being played and be getting really good at playing it. And that's fine. I don't think that's leadership. Think about what leading means. You're bringing people to where they're not. You're leading them somewhere. If you're just going to where everyone already is and then you're gonna add something, you're not leading anything, you're just adding to it. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't think it's it's leadership. So I think if you want to actually be a leader, you have to ignore conventional wisdom because it's usually wrong and lags behind conventional wisdom. Usually, way everyone's doing it is not the best way. It's just what what what everyone's been doing. You need the space to just reason from first principles and think about what should this be today. Classic example is, you know, Apple gets into phones. They don't say, oh, look at all these flip phones and these Nokia phones. Well, our phone's gonna flip in this Apple. The keyboard's gonna be a clicky apply keyboard. They said, let's reason from first principles. What's the technology available today? What should a mobile device be? They completely transformed the industry. Apple stock went up, like, 20 fold, and, you know, of course, we all have, smartphones now. But I if think you wanna qualify as a leader, you have to do the hard failure prone heavy lifting of reasoning from first principles and, and trying new things. There is kind of a pyramid of work to do, and the stuff at the bottom of the pyramid can be done by a lot a lot of different people. And as you get hired, someone who's very experienced, whatever, you know, you know, needs to be doing, and then you get to the very top, and it usually has to be the founder. I was spending so much of my time just swamped with bottom of the pyramid stuff, which is taking calls from new clients and, you know, payroll and hiring, you know, putting out ads for hiring and, you know, just, you know, cold emails and things like that. The actually thoughtful, really original creative part of my brain just hadn't there's no room for you right now. We have we have to get this stuff done. So then we started hiring, you know, but I'm still spending now a lot of my time thinking about managing the staff. The next level was to hire, you know, kind of senior directors that managed the rest of the staff. And now it becomes this kind of machine that's running, and suddenly I can live up at the top of the pyramid, a place that's been totally neglected, and that's where you think, what are we even doing here? Is this the right way to go? Are we are we reasoning from first principles here? Just stop question the big picture and that creative part of your brain that can actually innovate that, you know, we all have that in there. It suddenly woke up. What do you know? The company totally transformed and it grew hugely once we did that. So, you know, if you're managing the stuff at the bottom of the pyramid, actually, it's gonna be hard to have any kind of big picture change or growth. You're just gonna be making ends meet as you start to hire and you start to build a team that can actually take that lower pyramid stuff off your plate because it didn't have to be me doing that. In fact, a lot of people could do a great job at that stuff. I could start living up at the top of the pyramid in the stuff that only I can do, which is the actual writing itself. Once I started having the space to dig in and pull out, you know, kind of, deeper thoughts and my my kind of my best work, it started to develop a real community. A real community of people who were very, very dedicated to to the site and to me and to what I was doing. There's going to be, you know, the important kind of long term work, which often doesn't have a deadline, a specific deadline. It's not usually urgent. It's often the stuff that can happen anytime in the next month or anytime in the next couple You know, there's this, you know, this this tool, the Eisenhower matrix. It's this little 2 x 2 matrix where you've got, 1 axis is important and this axis is urgent. So you've got a box and you have 4 quadrants. And the stuff that I really wanna be working on is the important stuff, and most of the important stuff is not urgent. So it's that important but not urgent group of stuff. Meanwhile, there's the, you know, the unimportant urgent stuff, and there's a lot of that for any business. Not only is it not a good use of my time to do unimportant kind of logistical stuff, the burden of having to do the urgent stuff just constantly rips you away from what you're doing. And so that affects both work and out of work because the way I can get writing done is to put my headphones on, basically turn the Internet off, until like 2PM, and just sit there from 10AM to 2PM and just pound away and not have to worry about anything else. If Alicia weren't there and I hadn't, you know, been able to delegate a lot of the urgent stuff, I couldn't do that. I had to check the email. You never know when, you know, a timely thing's gonna come in. Someone says, you know, you got this offer. Do you wanna take it or not? Or someone's asking if they can do a call today or, you know, there's a oh, there's someone found a typo on the last post, you know, that needs to be fixed right now, or someone tweeted this thing about you and it's not sure. You might wanna respond to that. This is every there's stuff every week. Now, because I know Alicia's there, she has access email, she has everything I can see she can see, I just know she's on it. I can just put my headphones on and put my head down and focus and work. I can, with peace, sit there and focus, which is critical. But then also, this matters for stuff outside of work because especially, you know, and before I had a child, I often would kind of procrastinate for a lot of the day away, work really late into the, you know, into the night, or sometimes I'd wake up and just get started on work right away, or I'd just be on the computer in the morning. Now I have a 2 year old daughter and another 1 on the way, and the morning and the night are the times that I spend with her and I don't want to miss that. The more we kind of hired good people that we trusted, the more not only was I free to, you know, do the important work, but I also was free to be present and to not be beholden to all of the urgent unimportant work 24 7. Delegation is the enabler of better productivity and presence and peace of mind. You know, when I was 13, I pulled an all nighter the night before my bar mitzvah trying to get the my little speech ready, my Torah portion. I think we all thought that this is I'm I'm a kid. I'm being a silly kid right now. But then, you know, now I'm 17. I'm working on my, you know, big, you know, junior thesis paper. I pull an all nighter, the night before it's due. And I graduated college, and this problem persisted. The only time when it wasn't a problem was when I was working, you know, with other people on a project or something where there was accountability and there's a very, you know, near deadline, would get it done. Anything else that, you know, again, was in that kind of important but not urgent category didn't get done. And I graduated college, and this problem persisted. So I wrote about this because I was trying to explain to the non procrastinators why we do this, why procrastinators are like this, because they misunderstand it. They think you're lazy, you know, you're you're whatever. And it's not that. There's 2 characters in every human brain. There's, you know, this rational decision maker that is kind of your prefrontal cortex or whatever. It's the the very human side of you that's that can think ahead and see the big picture and make plans and just wants to do what makes sense because it's it's grown up. And then there's this limbic system. I call it the instant gratification monkey, and that part of our brain doesn't understand an advanced civilization, and it thinks it's in 30,000 BC in a tribe, and it just wants to conserve energy and, you know, do things that are easy and fun in the exact moment. That's a power struggle, I think, in every human brain, but non procrastinators at some point along the way figured out how to win that battle, and they just their monkey is tame. Procrastinators, it's that that battle just they they lose it again and again, and it's this short term thing. It's that I'm gonna work on this, but not this exact minute. I'm gonna start it in 5 minutes, but now 5 minutes later, well, I'm not gonna start it at this exact minute. I'll start it soon, and suddenly it's 4 hours later. And with a paper, I'd say, I'm not you know, it's I have 10 days to do it. Okay. So I'm not gonna do it today, the first day, but tomorrow, I'm gonna get started. Oh, I'm gonna I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll do it, you know, the third day. And before you know it, it's it's an all nighter the night before. How does a procrastinator do anything ever? If the if the monkey is winning the battle against the rational decision maker, what happens is then the deadline gets really close or there's danger of public embarrassment or some kind of career disaster, and that's when the the procrastinator has the third character who rushes into the room, the panic monster. So there is this other character in the brain, this third guy, and the panic monster rushes into the room and that's the 1 thing that scares the monkey away and you can get the work done. People like to say, oh, that's it's good because procrastination lets you percolate on things and lets you you know, it's good for creativity. And I would say that there's a balance. I think I think some people, when there's a new thing assigned, they actually get a different kind of anxiety, you know, from a new thing to the point where they just go and do it and they knock it out and hand it in without, you know, giving it time. And I think that maybe is not great for coming up with original ideas or really good creative ideas. But then there's this middle ground that I think is where you wanna be, and procrastinators are usually way too far in the other direction where they're not doing their best work either because they're also rushing it at the last second. Both the, you know, I think, Adam Grant calls it a precastinate or someone who gets it and does it on day 1 of 10, and the procrastinator does it on day 10 of 10, and both of those people are using 1 of the 10 days. I think in the end it is a habit. It's a it's a habit that you're in. Plan a is to come up with ways to actually improve and to become more of a grown up. But there's always plan b, is get yourself a panic monster. So, 1 thing I'll do is I'll say, I need to write 1000 words a day. So I'll say to a couple friends, who are also creators, we do this with each other. I'll say, okay. I need a panic monster. So for the next 2 weeks, every day, at the end of the day, if I haven't done 1000 words, I owe you each a 100. If I start getting behind on this and I don't do this, I mean, I'm gonna be down $2,000 in 2 weeks. Little things like that, I I that'll actually help. Now I think the long term goal is, again, to actually get better at managing this. So I use tools. You know, there's an app called Freedom on my computer and and my phone, and there's I I use a a hard piece of hardware called the brick, and I tap my phone to it, and my phone all the procrastination apps go away, and Freedom blocks them all on my computer. That helps. I make a goal to get up, don't even look I can't even see my text because I have the phone bricked. Just sit down, and I have to knock out 4 hours of deep focus. And when that's done, I'm free for the whole day. So instead of being in the psychology where I I don't work, I work for myself now, I can do this anytime today, go back to your childhood psychology, is I have to do this now. Oh, school sucks. Up. Saved by the bell. I'm free. I'm out. I can clock out. So that psychology helps because the monkey can get on board with it. Okay. Wait a second. It's only, you know, it's 08:30AM. You're telling me if we start right now, I can have the entire afternoon free? Okay. I'll do that. There's 1000000 different strategies, but, I think it's working with your own psychology, pretending you're it's like a dog you're trying to train, and getting good at being a trainer of the dog in your head.
