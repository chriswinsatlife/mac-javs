## Positioning Through Language

- Athena sells "world-class" and "elite" executive support, framed as a long-term, compounding partnership.
- The assistant role is positioned beyond admin: "strategic partnership" across "personal and professional" life.
- Hiring risk is reframed as a product feature: Athena "absorbs the risk" and provides "peace of mind" as a "membership".
- Differentiators repeat across pages: rigorous selection, training, management, security, and an AI plus human pairing.

Common positioning phrases pulled from pages:
- "World-class assistants" (homepage)
- "An evolution in support" (homepage)
- "AI-powered, human-led support" (homepage)
- "Peace of mind in a membership" (how it works)
- "Enterprise-grade security" (homepage)
- "No add-ons, no hidden fees" (security)

## Voice Traits

Calm, high standards, and direct:
- Short declarative sentences, often used as punches: "You don't have to do it all alone." (how it works)
- In reviewed pages, emphasis is on rigor, systems, and outcomes.

Outcome-first and executive-centric:
- Repeats benefits in capacity language: more time, focus, decision-making bandwidth, less stress.
- Frames delegation as a learnable skill and a leadership practice.

Human warmth without being casual:
- Empathetic to pain: distraction, decision fatigue, context switching.
- Rare slang; when informal, it's controlled and used for vividness in narrative blog posts.

Trust and safety as core tone:
- Security copy reads like a checklist of controls, responsibilities, and coverage.
- Uses "peace of mind" and "responsibility" framing more than fear framing.

## Point Of View

- Primary POV is second person: "you" is the default subject.
- Athena uses "we" for commitments, process, and responsibility.
- "Members" is used for clients on marketing pages (homepage, blog).

## Brand Vocabulary

Recurring terms:
- "Executive Assistant" and "EA" with parenthetical first use: "Executive Assistants (EAs)" (homepage)
- "assistant" and "Executive Assistant" are both used; careers pages use "Executive Partner (XP)".
- "strategic partnership", "capacity", "focus", "peace of mind", "long term"
- "vetted", "trained", "matching", "onboarding", "upskilling", "manager"
- "security", "coverage", "legal recourse", "device monitoring", "remote wipe", "cyberinsurance"

Avoided language patterns:
- In reviewed product pages, tone is not playful or ironic.
- In reviewed pages, CTAs are consistent and not written as high-pressure urgency.

## Copy Structure Patterns

Landing pages:
- Big promise headline.
- Short paragraph setting the frame.
- CTA.
- Sections that alternate: claim, proof mechanism, examples of tasks.

Blog posts:
- Intro that names a pain clearly.
- Scannable sections with descriptive subheads.
- Bulleted lists that are operational and specific.
- "Next step" CTA section near the end.

Comparison posts:
- "Compared and contrasted" positioning.
- Lists of pros, drawbacks, and decision criteria.
- Often includes a visual comparison asset.

## Syntax And Rhythm

- Prefers short, plain-English sentences with occasional longer explanatory ones.
- Uses sentence fragments for emphasis in marketing pages.
- Uses em dashes with spaces in long-form copy for contrast or clarification (example: "doesn't mean giving up control -- it's about...").

## Numbers And Specificity

- Uses specificity to build credibility: "top 0.5%", "300k+ global applicants", "40+ hrs/week", "$1M" (various pages).
- Uses plus signs for scale and compact notation (k, M) rather than writing out large numbers.
- Uses percentages and superlatives together when the proof is numerical.

## Capitalization And Naming

- Headings frequently use sentence case with deliberate hyphenation: "World-class assistants", "AI-powered, human-led support".
- CTAs are title case and short: "Get started", "Book a call", "Learn more", "Join now", "Apply Now".
- Product naming convention: "Athena" + role name, optionally with abbreviation in parentheses.

## Lists And Formatting

- Bullets are common and operational: lists of tasks, safeguards, benefits, steps.
- Numbered steps appear in process pages (how it works) and read like a guided journey.

## Claims And Proof Style

How Athena tends to justify claims:
- Mechanism first: matching protocol, onboarding, dedicated coaching, training infrastructure.
- Risk reduction: "Athena absorbs the risk" + security and coverage details.
- Concrete examples of tasks to make the offering legible.

## Guidance For Writing New Copy In This Voice

Do:
- Lead with the outcome for the reader, then explain the mechanism.
- Use clear, declarative sentences and avoid filler adjectives.
- Use credible specificity: numbers, safeguards, systems, process steps.
- Keep CTAs consistent with existing verbs and capitalization.
- Use the "partnership" frame, not "gig work" or "task rabbit" framing.

Do not:
- Overpromise with vague AI language; keep "AI" paired with human judgment and systems.
- Write in a playful or overly casual tone on product pages.
- Use heavy jargon; when jargon is unavoidable, translate it into plain English.
