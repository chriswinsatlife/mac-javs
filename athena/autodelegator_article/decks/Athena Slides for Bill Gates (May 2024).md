[Image: A flowchart diagram illustrating the workflow of the Athena system.]

1.  **Communication Tools:**
    -   Leverage existing tools that EAs and clients use to communicate.
    -   Examples: Slack, Email, Zoom.
    -   These tools feed into the Auto Delegator.

2.  **Auto Delegator:**
    -   System that automatically monitors communications and extracts tasks.
    -   Includes context.
    -   This feeds into the Task Platform.

3.  **Task Platform:**
    -   Centralized location where EAs manage all their tasks.
    -   Populated by auto delegator or manually by EA.
    -   Automatically breaks tasks into sub-tasks and assigns to human or AI agent.
    -   This platform assigns tasks to AI Agents.

4.  **AI Agents:**
    -   Individual agents that integrate with the task platform to execute sub-tasks.
    -   Examples: AI Agent: Calendar, AI Agent: Email, AI Agent: Travel.
