## Workflows as Agent Tools

"hey ai, can you research companies similar to athena (athenago.com) and get their monthly pricing, audience, mission, tagline, and 1 testimonial... and then create a new google spreadsheet with all the data?"

[Image: A screenshot showing the output of an AI agent workflow. On the right, a panel shows the execution log: "Find Similar Companies/Content & Create Google... Tool" which "Succeeded in 57.13s". An arrow points to this with the text "<1 min latency" and a thought bubble says "holy shit". On the left is the resulting Google Sheet titled "Athena Competitor Research". The sheet has columns for title, url, description, company_name, company_mission, tagline, audience, and testimonial, all populated with data for competitors like Tandemly, The After Co, Delegated, and Founder Coach.]

## Derived Context

"Buy me a flight" with ChatGPT sucks, but if you analyze every past flight in the inbox and create an SOP, it just magically works

[Image: A workflow diagram illustrating how to create a flight preference SOP.]

**Workflow Steps:**
1.  **Get Last X Reservation Emails** (from Gmail)
2.  **Edit Fields** (manual)
3.  **Limit** (to 25 items)
4.  **Analyze Flights** (using OpenAI)
5.  **Aggregate Analysis** (using OpenAI)
6.  **Create Google Doc** (with flight preference SOP)
7.  **Add Content** to Google Doc

**Caption:** Google Doc of flight preference is referenced by flight assistant ↑

## Dynamic Few Shots

"Write like me" or "write like my EA" doesn't work, even with examples of my writing—I use emoji with my close colleagues but not my attorney

[Image: A workflow diagram that solves the "write like me" problem by dynamically finding past emails.]

**Workflow Logic:**
A router (`Client/EA Router`) splits the task.
- **Top Path (Client):**
  1.  `Find Client Emails` (from Gmail)
  2.  `Limit`
  3.  `Generate Client Email Missive - Create Draft from Client` (passes found emails as examples)
- **Bottom Path (EA):**
  1.  `Generate Email Search String`
  2.  `Find EA Emails` (from Gmail)
  3.  `Limit1`
  4.  `Generate EA Email Missive - Create Draft from EA` (passes found emails as examples)

**Conclusion:** Getting previous emails I've sent to THAT person or a semantically similar person / conversation and passing into prompt solves this

## Context Hiding in Plain Sight

Gift shopping is hard, but an LLM can parse every purchase email where shipping address wasn't you, create structured data, build recipient profiles, and pattern-match to empower agent to shop

[Image: A detailed workflow diagram for automated gift recommendations.]

**Workflow Steps:**
1.  **Gmail - Get Purchase Confirmation Emails**
2.  **Clean Up Email Data**
3.  **Limit**
4.  **Categorize Gift vs. Personal**
5.  **Merge**
6.  **Filter for Gifts**
7.  **Create JSON**
8.  **Split JSON into Items**
9.  **Tavily - Enrich Gift Descriptions**
10. **Filter for Meghan's Gifts**
11. **Aggregate1**
12. **Browserless - Scrape Gift Recs Website**
13. **Create HTML of Gift Recs**
14. **Email Results**

**Conclusion:** Recommendations are legitimately next-level, selected more often than human-researched gift ideas that normally take 4-12 hours

## Messy Data Becomes an Enrichable Asset

My inbox won't tell you what gyms or spas I like, or what type of places I go to for haircuts ... but my credit card statement + LLM + APIs + web scraping will

[Image: A workflow diagram that enriches transaction data to automate tasks.]

**Workflow Steps:**
1.  **Teller API Call** (for credit card data)
2.  **Filter Transactions**
3.  **Trim Fields**
4.  **Aggregate Transactions**
5.  **OpenAI** (to analyze)
6.  **SerpAPI Google Local** (to find details)
7.  **Most Recent Haircut** (identified by OpenAI)
8.  **Derive Haircut Data**
9.  **If/Then Logic**
10. **Current Location**
11. **MultiOn - Create Session** (to book appointment)

**Conclusion:** Plus you can automate things like "schedule a haircut 6 weeks from the date of the most recent haircut transaction"

## Data Legibility is a Crucial Investment

Given the right context, LLMs can connect dots like turning logs into daily employee reports... time to start recording digital activity, calls, IRL convos, etc...

[Image: A diagram showing how various data inputs are combined to generate a detailed report.]

**Inputs:**
-   Browser Data
-   App Data
-   Network Data
-   Screenshots
-   \+ Company Context
-   \+ Project Mgr Data
-   \+ Personal Context
-   \+ Messages Context

**Example Prompt:**
`Below is some data from ActivityWatch, an open-source time tracker. You are analyzing data from a chief-of-staff to an American Executive during their working hours. What does it seem like the user has been working on today?...`

**Output (from CYAI bot):**
A detailed daily report including:
-   **Tasks Completed Today:** (e.g., Upgrade SerpApi, Update GPT assistant tools, Review autodrafter email, etc.)
-   **In-Progress Tasks:** (e.g., Brainstorm ideas for Bill Gates Presentation)
-   **Waiting / Blocked:** (e.g., Get Access to Anon)
-   **Activity Watch Completed Tasks:** (e.g., Created and managed automation workflows)
-   **Feedback on current delegations:** (e.g., "The Sign-Off Notes are a great practice...")
-   **Delegation ideas for next week:**

## AI as Teammate

Assign tasks in project manager to AI, it sends results to human for review

[Image: A side-by-side view of two tasks in a project management tool.]

**Task 1 (Assigned to AI):**
- **Assignee:** AL (AI)
- **Task:** Write a short substack newsletter based on the research paper in my vector database on financial incentives for medication adherence.

**Task 2 (Assigned to Human for Review):**
- **Assignee:** CY (Human)
- **Task:** Review first draft of newsletter on financial incentives for medication adherence.
- **Content:** A fully drafted newsletter article titled "Financial Incentives: A Game Changer in Medication Adherence" is in the task description, ready for human review and approval. It discusses concepts like loss aversion and cites the company Wellth.

## LLMs for Task/Value Discovery & Routing to Right Resource

AI discovers tasks in inbox, calendar, etc and creates task in project manager for another AI or human resource

[Image: A screenshot of a "CYCL To-Do List" in a project manager, populated with tasks automatically generated by an AI.]

**Example Tasks:**
-   Review autodelegator tasks from Greg Kamradt email re: Re: Intro: Jordan <> Greg
-   Review autodrafter email from Maverick Kuhn email re: Re: Chris x Thyself
-   Answer laptop specification questions for Carlos as Chris - via email comment

--

### Key Metrics & Concepts

-   > 50% of my EA's work is delegated by an AI
-   > 10% of AI-discovered tasks are completed by AI
-   AI proactively reviews human-assigned tasks and tries to take part/all of them from the human pre-emptively
-   Similar to healthcare ops concept of "practicing at the top of your license"

## Co-Pilot w/ Contextual Data + Assistance

AI reads browser/proxy/app data + screenshots, generates a prompt to assistant

[Image: A user is browsing the Marriott website for hotels in Bali. A Telegram chat with the CYAI bot is open, showing the AI has proactively provided relevant hotel options.]

**Quote:** "Based on what the person is doing, what data would be useful for the person?"

**AI Action:**
-   Get Marriott account #, surface hotel SOP, and run assistant search for other hospitality options

**Concept:** AI autonomously prompts AI based on ambient observation

---

## Co-Pilot Takes the Wheel

AI reads browser/proxy/app data + screenshots, generates a prompt to assistant, starts **working**

[Image: A user is viewing a blank "Meeting Bios AI" product spec template. A Telegram chat with the CYAI bot is open, suggesting it can complete the task for the user.]

**Quote:** "Looks like they're writing a product spec, let's grab the best resources on that and do it for them"

**Process:**
-   Get data from best-in-class reference templates / best practices (e.g. podcasts, substacks, etc—even for skills the user doesn't have)
-   Then add context from recent emails, messages, call transcripts (continuously logged in memory.txt)

**Results:**
-   EA with no PM training writes a pretty solid PRD
-   creates pretty solid FB ads
-   outperformed my full-time recruiter
