# Athena Superchat Preview

## What if ChatGPT knew everything about your client?

---

## Superchat does.
- Travel preferences
- Company details
- Professional relationships
- Gift purchases
- Writing style
- Recent conversations
- Recently edited files
- Much more

---

## So you can just say “find me a flight to Tokyo.”
It knows the client's departure airport, layover preferences, favorite airlines, and more.

It shows the flights your client would actually pick themselves—not generic results from Google.

---

## And you can just tell it “search for gifts Amanda would like.”
Because it knows what the client (or you) bought for Amanda in the past.

---

## Ask simple questions.
## Get incredible results.

---

## Examples

## Hotel research with built-in client preferences

[Image: A screenshot showing two parallel chat conversations within the Superchat interface. The left chat shows a query for accommodation in Bali, and the right chat shows a query for Airbnb options in Cebu City. Both AI responses are tailored based on the client "Chris's" known preferences.]

**Left Conversation:**
> **User:** Help me find accommodation in Bali for June 10-July 10. If possible I want places that I stayed with before

> **AI:** Okay, I've looked for options for a month-long stay in Bali (June 10 - July 10), keeping in mind Chris's preference for places similar to his previous stays in Canggu, like M4YA By Vanya Asset or The Kamala Guest House. The search focused on entire homes, apartments, or guesthouse-style accommodations with a kitchen, pool, and reliable Wi-Fi. A gym is a plus but less commonly found in these types of Airbnb listings.
> Here are some promising options, primarily in the Canggu area, which aligns with his previous long-stay preferences:
> 1. **Spirited Guesthouse Stay w/ Ricefield Views & Pool**
>    - ★ Guest favorite
>    - **Style:** Guesthouse (aligns with previous preferred style)
>    - **Cost:** Approx. $903 monthly
>    - **Key Features:** Pool, dedicated workspace, ricefield views, kitchen facilities (likely communal).
>    - **Why it might fit:** This is a guesthouse, similar to The Kamala Guest House, and offers desirable features like a pool and workspace.
>    - **Booking:** See Listing

**Right Conversation:**
> **User:** Can you give me airbnb options to cebu city for 1 week?

> **AI:** Okay, I've got some Airbnb options for a week in Cebu City (June 3 - June 10, 2025). Based on Chris's preferences for amenities like fast WiFi and a gym, here are some good choices:
> **Recommended Options:**
> 1. **New IT Park Studio, Fast WiFi, Infinity Pool, Gym**
>    - **Why:** Good all-around amenities that Chris often uses.
>    - **Cost:** $285 for 7 nights
>    - **Type:** Studio

## Flight research with built-in client preferences

[Image: A screenshot of the Superchat interface displaying a conversation about the client "Chris's" flight preferences.]

> **User:** Does Chris like American Airlines?
>
> **AI:** Based on his travel patterns, American Airlines is a secondary preference. He uses it regularly as part of the Oneworld alliance and has an AAdvantage number [REDACTED] associated with his bookings. His primary preference is for Star Alliance, with United Airlines being his most frequently used airline.
>
> **User:** Ok I'm about to book a flight. Can you tell me what the important details to know prior to booking flights for him are?
>
> **AI:** Okay, I've reviewed Chris's detailed flight preferences. Here are the key things to keep in mind before booking:
> **Key Booking Mandates:**
> 1. **Loyalty Programs:** Always add the correct frequent flyer numbers.
>    - United MileagePlus (Primary): XXXXX463 (or...)
>    - American AAdvantage (Secondary): [REDACTED]
>    - Include others as applicable (Delta, JetBlue, Air France, etc.).
> 2. **Known Traveler Number (KTN):** Always add [REDACTED] for TSA PreCheck.
> 3. **Name on Booking:** Use the full legal name as it appears on his passport. "Christopher Anthony York" is likely correct, but verify. Variations like "Christopher York" and "Christopheranthony York" have appeared.
> 4. **Seat Preference:** Aisle seat is strongly preferred, generally in the front to mid-cabin section.
> 5. **Baggage:** Ensure at least one checked bag (typically 20-30kg) is included or purchased, especially on LCCs. He usually travels with one checked bag (40L) and one large carry-on (30-35L).
> 6. **Meals (AirAsia):** If flying AirAsia, specifically book the "Vegetarian Value Pack meal." For other LCCs or Asian carriers, it's good to ask if a vegetarian meal is preferred.

## Search for places based on common client travel locations

[Image: A screenshot of the Superchat interface where a user asks for restaurant recommendations based on the client "Chris's" typical work location.]

> **User:** what's a good filipino restaurant near where chris usually works in the bay area?
>
> **AI:** Okay, I've found several highly-rated Filipino restaurants in and around the Bay Area where Chris typically works. Here are a few options:
>
> **Oakland:**
> 1. **FOB Kitchen (maps.google.com/...):** This spot in Temescal gets rave reviews for its traditional dishes with a modern twist, like pork adobo and lechon kawali. They also have a nice outdoor seating area. (4.5 stars, 443 reviews)

They specialize in lumpia (various fillings, including a bacon cheeseburger version) and also offer dishes like garlic noodles and garlic shrimp. They have an arcade corner with free games. (4.5 stars, 419 reviews)

- Periodically, the AI will review recent emails, meetings, and Google Drive files to update its memory on the client.
- Each workday, the AI will try to suggest tasks to help the client with; these may not be great ideas in V1, but let us know.
- If there is another app you want the AI to have data from, like meeting transcripts or a project management tool, tell the AI you want to “request a feature”.

> 1. Confirm all details for Chris York's rescheduled meeting with Luke Drago, which is set for today, May 16th.

(Link to Chris's calendar)
> 2. Prepare a concise pre-meeting briefing note for Chris York for his meeting with Luke Drago. This brief should cover:

## How to Test
- Athena AI Chat is invite-only
- Message someone already using it to join the waitlist

---

## Key Points
- When signing up, use the client's main email, not yours—the AI knows XP/client relationships
- If the client has multiple emails without forwarding, use their personal email
- It takes about 10-15 minutes for the client context to be available to the AI, so the AI won't know most details right after sign up — just wait a bit
- Don't share sensitive information like client medical history or company finances w the AI
- If you find a bug or want to request a feature, just tell the AI and it has a tool to notify the chat product team; don't use Glue or email anyone
- Right now, if you switch chats while the AI is trying to respond, it won't finish; wait for it to respond before going to another chat (switching to another tab in your browser is fine)

---

## Oath of Silence
- If you share the URL, you will be permanently banned
- You can share screenshots internally w Athena teammates on approved channels only
- Our analytics + tracking is probably better than your VPN / ad blocker / extensions 😉

## FAQs

- **What permissions or data are required to use the AI chat?**
  - To pull in the client's context, an AI searches and synthesizes information from Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive + researches the client and their company from public sources

- **What data is saved or stored by the system?**
  - AI summaries of the client's information, like purchase history or email threads or recently edited files are saved to a database, but never the actual email or file content
  - Conversations you have with the AI are stored and are visible to a small number of Athena teammates who work on the app; this is required to fix bugs, improve performance, etc

- **Can the AI overwrite, edit, or delete information like emails, invites, or files?**
  - No, the permissions are read-only; the AI cannot write email drafts, send emails, edit files, create calendar events, send meeting invitations, change calendar event descriptions, etc
