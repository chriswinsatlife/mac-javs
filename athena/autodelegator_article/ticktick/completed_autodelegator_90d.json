He writes, \"Can we edit this in a doc together?\" and shares the link. He also notes, \"Some of this text looks like it was from the ops outreach vs engineer outreach, so I reverted some of it back to the older language\" and \"I added the hyperlinks back in, but we can remove it if that was intentionally excluded.\" Requested actions: edit the Google Doc directly, confirm whether hyperlinks should remain, agree on final messaging, and then start sending to the current batch.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator AI Action Items \n\n**Action Items (Detected):**\n- Review and edit the Google Doc Jake shared: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qw_8orV76MTx4wJZyCQ4VuUNk4pwYGACpQ611BFvO1o/edit?usp=sharing   \n- Confirm whether the added hyperlinks should remain or be removed from the outreach copy   \n- Approve the final outreach text (engineer-focused language) and confirm to Jake to start sending this batch   \n- If any message variants are needed (ops vs engineer), specify which template to use for this batch   \n\n\n**Above and Beyond Action Items (Optional):**\n1. Create A/B test variants and tracking in Airtable and Missive to measure open/reply rates so you can iterate messaging after the first batch\n\n2.

Review billing history for both Vectara accounts in Chris's records to confirm charges and identify any discrepancies.\n\n2. Update Chris's financial tracker or Airtable CRM with the resolution status of the Vectara accounts and refunds.\n\n3.

It seems you had two accounts on our platform where one was deleted while the other one was not. The one that wasn't deleted was the one that was getting charged.\n\nAccount 1: Customer ID: 3913586750 Email: ea@chrisyork.co Name: Cognitive\n\nThis account was deleted at the end of Jan, 2025. No recent charges.\n\nAccount 2: Customer ID: 3184730687 Email: c@chrisyork.co Name: chrisyork.co\n\nThis account was not deleted, and you were getting charged for this. We have now deleted this account too, so you should not be charged anymore.\n\nPlease let us know if you need any further clarification.\n\nThanks, Tallat\nOn Sat, Aug 16, 2025 at 4:27 AM Chris York <c@chrisyork.co> wrote:\n\n> Hey,\n\nI just deleted my account.

The\nway mentioned earlier is something like updates+paul@, updates+josh@, etc\nas a *s*ingle email address, where \"updates@\" is the actual email address\nand Gmail ignores anything after the \"+\". That approach is the simplest,\nbut these aren't separate addresses.\n\nOption 1: Google Groups\n<https://support.google.com/a/answer/9400082?hl=en&src=supportwidget0&authuser=0#zippy=%2Cstep-create-a-group>\n- Like having an individual business Gmail account, the address can be\nanything we want\n- Can forward emails to whoever you want by either adding them as a member\nof the group or setting up some kind of API\n<https://support.google.com/a/answer/10427204?sjid=8431625313676321847-NC&authuser=0>\nautomation\n- Groups *can* have a shared inbox, but in this case, we'd probably not\nenable that and simply use them as forwarding addresses\n- Cannot send emails\n- No direct way for founder to change the alias once created (at least to\nmy knowledge)\n- Does not cost money\n- Probably more platform risk that Google makes breaking changes or shuts\nthis down\n\nOption 2: Individual Google Workspace Accounts\n- You have to pay $12-25/mo for each individual account\n- Richer automation potential down the road\n- None of the limitations of the above\n\nBoth should be somewhat easy to automate via APIs (will have to\ndouble-check, but quick skim suggests we can create accounts automatically\nand set up forwarding easily). The more fun part is the AI parsing the\nupdates and doing stuff with that.\n\nIf you want to get started on this, we'd probably need: 1) a Powerset\nGoogle Workspace account that has full admin access, 2) an Oauth client\nwith directory/identity/admin API scopes (which we can set up in Google\nCloud with the former, and 3) a list of the emails (v1 attempt here\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SARhmfN_Vy254HvMyQihI-dE4LW1i6m_9B86eXvue84/edit?gid=265942279#gid=265942279>\n).\n\n—Chris\n\nOn July 30, 2025 at 10:31 PM, Jake Zeller (jake@powerset.co) wrote:\n\nSorry for the late reply while I've been offline!\n\nYes, this is exactly what we need to do.\n\nIdeally we could create individually-branded emails for each founder. For\nexample, Paul already has an email for this he created on his own:\ncopple.invest@gmail.com\nOn Tue, Jul 22, 2025 at 6:21 AM Chris York <c@chrisyork.co> wrote:\n\nGreat idea.\n\nWe built a couple workflows for \"Helping\" previously, where it basically\nparsed individual asks out of investor update emails and created tasks for\nthe AI agent to research using the CRM as a tool. So for example, founder A\nasks for CMO intros, the AI can access (or research) details about founder\nA's company/customers/marketing, then run a search through the CRM and\noutput a draft email to the founder with possible intros for them to\napprove. Obviously someone manually double-checks the names/LinkedIns\nbefore hitting send. I think this is a great use case. The v2 would be\npicking up on implied needs that aren't explicitly in the updates, e.g. job\nposts from their website/social or potential customer intros from the CRM\nmatching their implied ICP.\n\nA minor tactical thing might be whether to create 20-40 separate emails\nvs. having one email (maybe with aliases, e.g. updates+paul@powerset.co where\nGmail ignores stuff after the +). Probably a lot less operational overhead\nbut a little more stress on the routing logic.\n\nA variant of this might also involve creating an email that portco\nfounders can message when they want an intro outside the window of the\ninvestor updates. Not sure how much it would be utilized, but it might be\ncool to query the CRM via AI agent that way, since it feels less like\nyou're bothering someone or using social capital if it's just an AI.

Chris York proposes building an AI-powered system to parse founder update emails, extract requests, and automate drafting intro emails from CRM data, with human oversight to ensure quality. They discuss managing email logistics between multiple branded emails versus aliasing. Future versions may allow founders to request intros via an AI-enabled email, reducing friction. Coordination with Arthur is suggested if CRM modifications are needed, while Carlos could start email parsing and LLM extraction once example emails are provided.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator AI Action Items \n\n**Action Items (Detected):**\nCoordinate with Arthur regarding CRM read/write access or new object types if needed for the AI system. Provide Carlos with example investor update emails covering all three use cases to begin email parsing and large language model (LLM) extraction development. Decide on the preferred email management approach (multiple individual emails vs. single email with aliases) and communicate it to the team.\n\n**Above and Beyond Action Items (Optional):**\n1. Develop a prototype dashboard in Airtable or Notion that visualizes parsed founder requests and AI-suggested intros for quick review by Chris and team.\n\n2. Investigate integrating the AI email parsing system with CRM analytics to generate regular reports on top angel investors acknowledged and actionable portfolio insights.\n\n3. Explore automating initial human review triggers in the workflow using N8n based on confidence scores from the AI agent to optimize operational efficiency.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator Agent Research  \n\nN/A\n\n---  \n\n**Original Email:** \nSorry for the late reply while I've been offline!\n\nYes, this is exactly what we need to do.\n\nIdeally we could create individually-branded emails for each founder. For example, Paul already has an email for this he created on his own: copple.invest@gmail.com\nOn Tue, Jul 22, 2025 at 6:21 AM Chris York <c@chrisyork.co> wrote:\n\n> Great idea.\n\nWe built a couple workflows for \"Helping\" previously, where it basically\nparsed individual asks out of investor update emails and created tasks for\nthe AI agent to research using the CRM as a tool. So for example, founder A\nasks for CMO intros, the AI can access (or research) details about founder\nA's company/customers/marketing, then run a search through the CRM and\noutput a draft email to the founder with possible intros for them to\napprove. Obviously someone manually double-checks the names/LinkedIns\nbefore hitting send. I think this is a great use case. The v2 would be\npicking up on implied needs that aren't explicitly in the updates, e.g. job\nposts from their website/social or potential customer intros from the CRM\nmatching their implied ICP.\n\nA minor tactical thing might be whether to create 20-40 separate emails\nvs. having one email (maybe with aliases, e.g. updates+paul@powerset.co\nwhere Gmail ignores stuff after the +). Probably a lot less operational\noverhead but a little more stress on the routing logic.\n\nA variant of this might also involve creating an email that portco\nfounders can message when they want an intro outside the window of the\ninvestor updates. Not sure how much it would be utilized, but it might be\ncool to query the CRM via AI agent that way, since it feels less like\nyou're bothering someone or using social capital if it's just an AI. In\ntheory, you want the lowest information frictions possible so they can get\nintros to relevant customers/talent/etc as early as possible. We'd need to\nbe more confident in the AI's performance though, and then maybe have a\nhuman review/greenlight the requests if the portco founder finds one they\nlike and wants to connect.

He requests Kanishk's help in gaining access as a developer or admin to generate/assign these keys. The APIs impacted include Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 for Superchat. The API usage and related charges are expected to be minimal.

Verify current API key management and permissions protocols to prevent similar access issues in future testing.\n\n2. Coordinate a brief technical walkthrough session between Kanishk, Carlos, and developers to ensure clear understanding of API key administration needs.\n\n3. Document the API key lifecycle and access procedures in a shared knowledge base (e.g., Notion) to streamline onboarding and troubleshooting.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator Agent Research  \n\nN/A\n\n---  \n\n**Original Email:** \nHi Vasu/Kanishk,\n\nWe've suddenly run into issues with testing out stuff on Cursor due to expired Anthropic credentials. We're not able to view/create existing API keys under the account's permissions, and also can't enable Opus 4, Sonnet 4, and other APIs for Superchat.\n\nLikely a \"developer\" or \"admin\" is required to generate/view/assign API keys so we were wondering if you could help us get access. Anthropic is not a main provider for most of the use cases, so API usage and charges are expected to be minimal.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 14, 2025 at 2:17 PM Carlos Lucero <carlos@athena.com> wrote:\n\n> Was a pleasure to help! 🎉\n\nWould love to play around with the pilot implementation (no pun\nintended) once it's out.\n--Carlos\n\nOn Sat, Jul 12, 2025 at 9:23 AM Kanishk Kalra <kanishk.kalra@athena.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Chris and Carlos,\n> I wanted to let you know that we have implemented the first version of\n> deep research in the xpilot.

Half of the\nqueries are about the person, and half are about the company (3-5 queries\neach). We de-dupe URLs and merge the content (both Firecrawl and Exa both\ncan return the full page content for URLs in search results), and then pass\nup to ~20 URLs worth of text to an LLM for person and company separately.\nI am currently just doing a search using just the client name and the\ncompany name.

I was looking at a complete redesign of the memory part of xPilot to split episodic and semantic memory and then combine them into long term memory. We presently dont pre generate a memory summary for users which leads to a cold start problem. I remember you generate this memory and pre populate it from email and calender\nWas wondering if you can share your implementation of the code which pulls in emails, calenders and other client information to create the pre populated client summary of memory. Could be useful for xPilot to avoid the cold start problem.\nTIA!!!

I don't think we were formally introduced, and I've heard nothing but great things about you.\nI'm grateful you took the time to play around with our prototype. To answer a few of your questions and provide other context:\nThe Y-1 model definitely has higher latency; there are a lot of low-hanging fruit here, but we were really focused on validating other hypotheses for the V1 (e.g. around automated context extraction, tools, etc), so appreciate your patience with this + other polish issues\nMemory or context injection is actually not the biggest lever here, incidentally, although per-user prompt caching w/ some of the context would be moderately helpful—Shortwave does this to great effect\nMost of the user context available to the system is injected only during tool calls\nFor example, if the model receives a request related to booking a flight, it calls a tool where the Postgres column with user flight preferences is passed in the context to an LLM at two points: 1) to populate parameters for flight search API (e.g. \"always flies business class\"), and 2) to filter/sort the available flights and pass the response back to the main tool\n\nThere is also a tool where the AI can decide if it needs additional context, and it basically gets a list of column names and can retrieve one or more columns from that tool before using another one (e.g. review deep research on user's company before using Firecrawl/Exa to research competitors)\n\nThere is no RAG tool for it to check emails, calendar, or drive at this time\nThe \"the model keeps waiting even after the response is complete and refuses to accept new queries\" issue is a known bug\nOur main goal here was not to build a production-ready application for rollout with all the XPs, but to build a playground where we can experiment and validate certain hypotheses related to AI augmentation or performance of common workflows.\nThe first of these was the notion that a great deal of context about the client can be found via certain AI workflows and would improve the usefulness of the tool. This seems to be accurate; at least, my own XPs report the flight search and hotel search are very useful since the preferences are baked in. They also believe that they would've benefitted a great deal from the other context summaries like email thread analysis and network context if they hadn't already worked with me for a long time. I've seen the current format of Athena client user manuals, and the context we have extracted in various domains here seems to be an order of magnitude more useful to an XP on day 1.\nThe second is the automatic identification of tasks. We do this as a daily cron job that reviews recent email threads, edited files in Drive, and meetings. Then, the AI pushes some suggestions in a daily thread, which has some hidden context about those tasks in the system prompt and should enable the XPs to easily tackle the suggestions (if accurate). This is quite behind the other features in terms of the attention its received, but we believe it's a promising angle. I have a much more sophisticated workflow personally where tasks are pulled from my emails, call transcripts, calendar, drive, and other sources to have an AI autodelegate tasks to our project management SaaS. We scoped this down for V1, partly due to it needing less validation. This is probably\n\n---\n\n### Execution\n- [Email Autodelegator v3 - 1620448](https://n8n.chrisyork.co/workflow/cnbCWgDj2ngb6nM5/executions/1620448)",

Chris York previously suggested trading notes on AI projects and discussing training data bottlenecks in big AI labs, with flexibility on meeting times. Action required is to confirm or adjust the proposed meeting time.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator AI Action Items \n\n**Action Items (Detected):**\nConfirm or propose alternative timing for the catch up meeting on Thursday the 19th at 8am PT.\n\n**Above and Beyond Action Items (Optional):**\n1. Prepare a brief summary of recent AI developments at Powerset and Athena to share during the meeting.\n\n2. Compile key insights or questions related to AI training data bottlenecks and long-horizon tasks from internal teams.\n\n3. After the meeting, organize notes and follow-up tasks in Airtable to track potential collaborations or introductions.\n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator Agent Research  \n\nN/A\n\n---  \n\n**Original Email:** \nLet’s do it man - excited to catch up\n\nHow 8am PT Thursday the 19th?\n\nGreg Kamradt\n\nOn Mon, Jun 16, 2025 at 2:58 AM Chris York <c@chrisyork.co> wrote:\n\n> Hey,\n\nWhat's been up? Hope the kiddo is doing well and you're able to keep your\nsquat #s up despite the child- and AI-related stuff going on!\n\nIf you're up for it, I'd love to catch up. Can trade some notes on some\nfun AI stuff we've built at Powerset and Athena, and also wanted to ask a\ncouple things about what you think the big AI labs might be bottlenecked on\nin terms of training data. We've had some inbound related to ways we could\nhelp with long-horizon tasks, RL'ing background agents on real-world work\nprocesses the EAs work on, etc. I figured you might have some really good\nintel from Arc and other stuff to supplement what we've heard from people\nlike Surge, Scale, the big AI companies, etc.\n\nI'm not sure if you're more of a morning person or a late afternoon type,\nbut 9AM/10AM Bali time is 6PM/7PM the previous day in the Bay Area, or\n10PM/11PM Bali time is 7AM/8AM the same day in Marin. I don't mind doing\nrelatively late like 11/11:30pm if evening are easier for you.\n\nLmk what works and can get things set up. And def always happy to repay\nthe favor with anything I could help with in terms of intros, EA stuff, etc.\n\n—Chris\n\n---\n\n### Execution\n- [Email Autodelegator v3 - 1619970](https://n8n.chrisyork.co/workflow/cnbCWgDj2ngb6nM5/executions/1619970)",

I don't think we were formally introduced, and I've heard nothing but great things about you.\n\nI'm grateful you took the time to play around with our prototype. To answer a few of your questions and provide other context:\n\nThe Y-1 model definitely has higher latency; there are a lot of low-hanging fruit here, but we were really focused on validating other hypotheses for the V1 (e.g. around automated context extraction, tools, etc), so appreciate your patience with this + other polish issues\n\nMemory or context injection is actually not the biggest lever here, incidentally, although per-user prompt caching w/ some of the context would be moderately helpful—Shortwave does this to great effect\n\nMost of the user context available to the system is injected only during tool calls\n\nFor example, if the model receives a request related to booking a flight, it calls a tool where the Postgres column with user flight preferences is passed in the context to an LLM at two points: 1) to populate parameters for flight search API (e.g. \"always flies business class\"), and 2) to filter/sort the available flights and pass the response back to the main tool\nThere is also a tool where the AI can decide if it needs additional context, and it basically gets a list of column names and can retrieve one or more columns from that tool before using another one (e.g. review deep research on user's company before using Firecrawl/Exa to research competitors)\nThere is no RAG tool for it to check emails, calendar, or drive at this time\n\nThe \"the model keeps waiting even after the response is complete and refuses to accept new queries\" issue is a known bug\nOur main goal here was not to build a production-ready application for rollout with all the XPs, but to build a playground where we can experiment and validate certain hypotheses related to AI augmentation or performance of common workflows.\n\nThe first of these was the notion that a great deal of context about the client can be found via certain AI workflows and would improve the usefulness of the tool. This seems to be accurate; at least, my own XPs report the flight search and hotel search are very useful since the preferences are baked in. They also believe that they would've benefitted a great deal from the other context summaries like email thread analysis and network context if they hadn't already worked with me for a long time. I've seen the current format of Athena client user manuals, and the context we have extracted in various domains here seems to be an order of magnitude more useful to an XP on day 1.\n\nThe second is the automatic identification of tasks. We do this as a daily cron job that reviews recent email threads, edited files in Drive, and meetings. Then, the AI pushes some suggestions in a daily thread, which has some hidden context about those tasks in the system prompt and should enable the XPs to easily tackle the suggestions (if accurate). This is quite behind the other features in terms of the attention its received, but we believe it's a promising angle. I have a much more sophisticated workflow personally where tasks are pulled from my emails, call transcripts, calendar, drive, and other sources to have an AI autodelegate tasks to our project management SaaS. We scoped this down for V1, partly due to it needing less validation. This is probably amongst the highest leverage tech assets the company could build, and we've spent enough time on it previously to know that it's very feasible from an implementation & AI capabilities standpoint.\n\nThere is a third hypothesis around \"workflows as tools.\" This is somewhat embedded in the implementation of the hotel and flight tools, but we are bullish that a lot of common XP workflows and artifacts can have their best practices & overall process baked into a mostly deterministic workflow with a little AI sprinkled in. This reduces the need to train XPs to be really good at some specific task, like writing a meeting bio or building a prospect list or whatever, and there could be industry-specific ones based on the client. We also may be able\n\n---\n\n### Execution\n- [Email Autodelegator v3 - 1616686](https://n8n.chrisyork.co/workflow/cnbCWgDj2ngb6nM5/executions/1616686)",

We caught the attacks early, removed unauthorized access, and issued reimbursements for any unauthorized transactions. While we remain vigilant in watching out for these attacks, there are some simple things you can do to keep yourself safe. As part of our commitment to your  , we want to share some important information about phishing attacks and two steps you can take to protect yourself. **What are phishing attacks?** Fraudsters phish to trick people into revealing sensitive banking information by pretending to be a trustworthy source. They can use fake emails, text messages, phone calls, apps, or social media pages, and in this most recent case, fake ads (see example below).   **Fake ads are tricky--here are some safeguards:** **Protect yourself from fake ads** When you search for \"mercury banking,\" you might see ads for fake sites at the top of your results. These ads can be tricky--they may even display  but actually take you somewhere else entirely. Here's how to protect yourself: Install an ad blocker. Here are some good ones to try:  ,-,  ,  . All of these ad blockers allow you to selectively enable ads on sites you'd still like to support.Access Mercury by typing our official website ( ) directly into your browser or by using our official app.If you're unsure whether a link or an ad is genuine, contact us directly at  .  **Set up a passkey** Mercury now supports advanced authentication methods, including FaceID, fingerprint recognition, and push notifications. Passkeys provide superior security because they generate unique digital keys that work exclusively with mercury.com's verified domain. Not only are they more secure, they're also more convenient, letting you skip typing your email, password, and 6-digit code. To set up a passkey, read   then  . One thing to remember: If you're on a phishing site, it may still request your password, even if you have passkeys set up. If you notice that passkey login isn't available, double-check that you're on  . Questions about security?

The preliminary tax liability is $7,105.\n\nAlso, we noticed that in 2022 there was no payment made in regards to Cognitive’s tax liability in its return.  We received in April a collection notice regarding this tax due.  Do you have any evidence of making this payment to Hacienda in 2022 regarding the 2021 return?  If not, I’m afraid that the payment must be made on or before the end of June which is $13,002.17.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let us know.\n\nThank you,\n\n[photo-logo]\nIgnacio Cotto, CPA\nTax Associate Etrends Group\nPuerto Rico Office\n \nOffice: (787)<tel:(844)%20455-0500> 691-0107  Direct: (385) 386-6033 Fax: (844) 660-6100<tel:(844)%20660-6100>\nEmail: ignacio@etrendsgroup.com<mailto:ignacio@etrendsgroup.com> W: www.etrendsgroup.com<https://img.newoldstamp.com/r/530469/w>\nA: 954 Ponce De Leon Ave, Miramar Plz.

Create a shared Airtable calendar that dynamically tracks Chris and Haider’s evolving availability for easier real-time scheduling updates and share access with Froi and Haider’s team.\n\n\n2. Build an N8n automation that sends proactive reminders and prompts to both Chris and Haider 48 hours before tentative meeting windows to confirm or adjust availability efficiently.\n\n\n3.

Customers who use Trading API keys for Auditor, Admin, or Fund Management functions will also need to take action. **What do I need to do?** Please update your existing Trading API key settings by assigning Trusted IPs or choosing Unrestricted access by   **Monday, June 30, 2025 at 9 pm ET.** If you do not complete this action by this time, any new API calls will be automatically rejected until this action is completed. **Do I have to set Trusted IPs for my Trading API keys?** No, if you would prefer not to assign Trusted IPs to your API keys, you may select Unrestricted access for your API keys. **How do I select Trusted IPs for my API keys or set them to be Unrestricted?** After signing in to your Gemini app on web or mobile, go to _Settings_ \\> _API_ and navigate to the _ellipsis_ of your existing API key(s) and click _Edit_. Select _Trusted IPs_ and add the list of IP addresses that you will use to call Gemini’s APIs. Alternatively, if you do not wish to select Trusted IPs, you can choose to select Unrestricted. Save these new API key settings for all your existing API keys by June 30, 2025 at 9 pm ET to ensure no disruption to future API calls. **Please Note:** If you are an API user with group-level or account-level access, you will need to take these actions for each account you oversee. If you access your API with a VPN, you will likely want to select Unrestricted access unless you are 100% certain of the policies by which your provider assigns IPs. If you have IP allowlisting enabled already at the group-level or account-level, and choose to add Trusted IPs at the API level, the Trusted IPs will need to match, or be a subset of the existing group-level or account-level IPs.

Carlos has confirmed that Ace’s account is whitelisted and ready for use. Action items: Ace should test Superchat and then “ping” Jonathan to arrange the demo session.  \n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator AI Action Items  \n\n**Action Items (Detected):** \n- Inform Ace Padua that Carlos acknowledges the plan for Ace to test Superchat for a couple of days and then coordinate a Zoom demo with Jonathan Swanson.  \n\n- Confirm Carlos will be available to facilitate or schedule the Zoom session once Ace is ready.  \n\n- No immediate action is required from Chris York or Carlos beyond this coordination unless Ace or Jonathan provides further updates.  \n\n**Above and Beyond Action Items (Optional):** \n1. Create a shared Airtable base to track feedback and feature requests from Ace and Jonathan during the Superchat testing, enabling real-time collaboration and prioritization.\n\n2. Set up an automated N8n workflow to notify relevant internal team members when Ace or Jonathan submits feedback or schedules the demo, ensuring proactive internal alignment.\n\n3. Prepare a concise Coda doc summarizing Superchat’s key features and potential use cases tailored to ZenBusiness, facilitating an informed and productive demo session.  \n\n---  \n\n# Autodelegator Agent Research  \n\n**Research Query:** \nLocate detailed case studies and lesser-known success stories of Superchat implementations in businesses similar to ZenBusiness, focusing on concrete outcomes, user adoption challenges, and innovative use cases, to create a deeply insightful, tailored Coda document that will maximize the effectiveness of the upcoming demo and decision-making process.  \n\n**Answer:** \n  \n\n---  \n\n**Original Email:** \nSo exciting! Ace, once you've played around with it for a couple days ping me and let's zoom and you can demo it to me.
