The AI that reads all my emails and then creates a task in the task manager for Carlos or for the AI or for Ann to do. Easy. I mean, it runs hundreds of times a day. It's great because it avoids anything being dropped where it's like, oh, you know, the email got read, but nobody created a task for it and it didn't get followed up. It relates exactly to Athena's core business. It's a problem everybody has. And a lot of the times the AI finds ways to delegate. The client wouldn't delegate themselves. Right. Or might be reluctant to. So it kind of makes it the default behavior, which, you know, in behavioral psychology is very important. So what's great is a lot of the time, you know, by the time I check my email, it's already been done, you know, and that's like, that's the win Condition for delegation generally. Right?
