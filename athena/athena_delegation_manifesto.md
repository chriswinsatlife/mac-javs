# **The Delegation Manifesto**

## Introduction

We are all beneficiaries of uniquely impactful and productive people who came before us, though we may fail to perceive their intricate latticeworks of leverage. From Cicero to Disney, Newton to Jobs, Kant to Lee Kuan Yew—the great producers of our species were wise enough not to attempt everything alone. A myopically soloist approach to their endeavors would have left humanity far worse off.

Those with prodigious vision and talent bend the arc of the future through orchestrating time, attention, and effort far beyond their own.

In a word, they delegate.

And the world benefits.

### **Power Laws of Progress**

The paragons of our species don’t merely outperform their contemporaries by factors of two or ten—their impact exceeds their peers' by orders of magnitude. This is the power law of human accomplishment, and it holds true whether your talents are measured in patents granted, records sold, papers cited, or dollars of market capitalization.

The median company has one employee. The median painter produces zero works gracing gallery walls. The median president or emperor is largely forgotten in the sands of time. In essence, the near entirety of human welfare and our species' continued progress is ultimately dependent upon a small number of outliers in each generation across various domains.

The sextet of luminaries mentioned earlier share little in common—and perhaps even less with Carl Sagan, Nelson Rockefeller, David Bowie, Enzo Ferrari, Napoleon Bonaparte, Buddha, Pablo Picasso, Winston Churchill, Bill Gates, and Voltaire. But every one of them had a personal assistant.

So did Caesar. So did Einstein. So did Darwin. And Mark Twain. And Salvador Dalí.

Throughout history, nearly all people of consequence across virtually every field of human endeavor have sought to maximize their impact through trusted assistants and the skillful utilization of others.

Though they may have existed in different centuries, different disciplines, and—in some ways, entirely different worlds—they all saw the same Pareto frontier.

They all delegated.

And we are all better for it.

### **Sins of Squandered Potential**

When the greatest inventor, thinker, or artist of their generation spends untold hours on administrative trivialities, they are not merely making a careless error in productivity. They are depriving society of inventions, ideas, and experiences that precious few others could produce. In a very real sense, they are committing an act of potentially intergenerational harm.

We are fortunate that there have been more prolific delegators like Einstein and Darwin, and fewer reluctant ones like da Vinci. Aware of his prodigious talents, Leonardo was a harsh judge of his lifetime output of twenty (mostly incomplete) paintings. Towards his death, he lamented, "I have wasted my hours. I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have."

Einstein may have been 80-85% as productive without a personal assistant safeguarding his focus. But the theory of general relativity may lie in that last 10%.

Jonas Salk could have likely developed the technologies to render the polio virus inert himself, rather than delegating it to Julius Youngner. Perhaps it would have only delayed the vaccine by a few months, but those who perished in that interim would not have been impressed.

If Steve Jobs had answered every email, scheduled every meeting, and wrote every document personally, he may still have led the team in creating the iPhone. But a less pristine execution could have cost thousands of jobs—not just at Apple, but across the entire developer ecosystem and supply chain. Such a sin of omission would tally billions in forgone profits and incalculable loss of consumer surplus. In the ledger of harms, the costs to Steve himself would number least.

History does not award style points for doing everything oneself. We know this from the most consequential of its authors, virtually all of whom penned its pages with ink that was not entirely their own.

### **The Hidden Hands of History**

The cultural and intellectual forebears of modernity delegated not just to create time or mental space to produce their greatest works; they delegated core parts of the works themselves. The signature achievements of a staggering number of historic figures were largely accomplished through other people.

The Wright brothers delegated the design and construction of the first plane engine to their bicycle shop assistant. Without this, they most assuredly would not have flown at Kitty Hawk when they did.

Darwin does not even mention the famous Galapagos finches in On the Origin of Species—the first evolutionary tree ever drawn features the domestic pigeon, and the data was collected through an elaborate network of breeding experiments he delegated to an "army of fact gatherers."

Edison assigned the testing and procurement of material for the filament of the first incandescent bulb. His assistant found it all the way in Kyoto—where a shrine was erected to commemorate the occasion and stands to this day.

Walt Disney delegated the character design and initial animation of a particularly famous mouse.

John Snow had his assistant literally risk his life to collect data on the 1854 cholera epidemic in London, which formed the bedrock of modern epidemiology.

Einstein delegated the mathematical formalization of general relativity to Marcel Grossmann.

And Henry Ford delegated the lion's share of work on the automotive assembly line to his aide, Charles Sorenson. Sorenson, in turn, delegated most of the work to _his_ assistant, Clarence Avery.

The list goes on and on, despite most of the records being lost to history.

The greatness of these individuals is not diminished by their delegation, their greatness was borne of it.

### **Leverage as Moral Imperative**

Humans have always sought to multiply their output, whether physical production through industrial apparatus or cognitive labors via artificial intelligence.

All people—especially those of consequence—naturally seek leverage.

Greatness does not bottleneck itself.

Greatness multiplies its impact.

Greatness delegates.

In a world where time is finite, but the potential for impact is infinite, delegation is not just a strategy—it's a necessity for maximal progress and human flourishing.

##

## An Evolutionary Imperative

Delegation is not a modern management tactic; it is the very cornerstone of our cognitive evolution. From the microscopic labyrinths of our neural pathways to the macroscopic scale of human civilization, the ability to distribute tasks has been the silent architect of our ascendancy.

### **The Brain that Delegated Itself**

Our neurobiology evolved around the principle of delegation eons before we conceived of org charts or productivity gurus. As a seminal study in Frontiers in Neuroscience elucidated, "The ability to delegate control over repetitive tasks from higher to lower neural centers may be a fundamental innovation in human cognition." Delegation is not a trite resource management trick; it's the very blueprint of our neural architecture.

The human brain, in its relentless pursuit of efficiency, has crafted an intricate hierarchy of task distribution. Complex, novel challenges are tackled by the prefrontal cortex—our cognitive command center. As tasks become routine, they're offloaded to lower, more automated neural structures, liberating our higher cognitive functions for the kind of abstract thinking that birthed quantum mechanics and sonnets alike.

Our brain was not merely wired for delegation; it was wired by delegation.

### **The Species of Comparative Advantage**

Homo sapiens didn't outcompete Neanderthals through brute strength or superior individual intelligence. Our triumph was orchestrated by our unparalleled ability to collaborate and delegate at scale. R.D. Horan and colleagues found "that the development of rudimentary economic exchange institutions (trade and division of labor) could have enabled humans to seal the fate of Neanderthals, even if biology was against them initially."

This is not speculative anthropology. The archaeological record provides compelling evidence. Upper Paleolithic settlement patterns reveal "high degrees of scheduling and forward planning"—hallmarks of a species that had mastered the art of task distribution. Our ancestors weren't just hunter-gatherers; they were proto-project managers, coordinating complex activities across time and space.

Even in primitive contexts, we see evidence of this innate understanding. Among Bolivian hunter-gatherers, task delegation is not merely about efficiency—it's a crucial medium of learning for children. Those delegated to harvest rice and other cultigens achieve significantly higher daily caloric returns than their non-delegated peers, even after controlling for age, sex, and body mass index.

Delegation benefited all involved—not just the originator of the task, but the entire tribe and its descendants.

This pattern of delegation and specialization has only accelerated with time. As societies grew more complex, so did our methods of collaboration. The transition from hunter-gatherer bands to agrarian societies, then to industrial nations, and now to our globalized knowledge economy, has been marked by ever-increasing levels of specialization and, consequently, delegation.

Adam Smith recognized this when he wrote,

"It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy… What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom."

This principle, writ large, underlies the entire global economy—a vast, intricate web of delegation that spans continents and industries. The fate of humanity's great kingdom has always depended on how skillfully we distribute our labor and accomplish our tasks, from the primordial decisions around who would hunt versus who would gather.

### **Modern Manifestations**

This biological imperative persists in our modern world. Humans are wired to pursue outcomes with the least effort and maximize utility. Even people with low incomes delegate responsibilities like food delivery, rideshare, and home repair at high rates. For instance, the plurality of Lyft riders come from households with annual incomes under $50,000. This isn't frivolous luxury—it's an intuitive grasp of comparative advantage and time value by those with the smallest margins for error.

The modern manifestations of delegation extend far beyond simple task assignment and the gig economy. It's embedded in our technological infrastructure, corporate hierarchies, and social institutions. The CEO delegating strategic decisions to managers, the programmer leveraging AI as a co-pilot, and the parent outsourcing tutoring all participate in a grand, species-wide experiment in task distribution.

As our capacity for delegation grows, so does the complexity of the systems we create. The challenge of modern delegation lies not just in offloading tasks, but in orchestrating increasingly intricate networks of human and artificial agents. The most successful individuals and organizations are those that can navigate this complexity, creating systems of delegation that are both robust and flexible.

Ultimately, delegation is not just a tool for personal productivity or organizational efficiency. It's the very mechanism by which our species has achieved its dominance, and it will continue to be the key to our biological and technological evolution. As more of our work is accomplished through means extending beyond our own bodies and brains, the skillful orchestration of these hybrid human-artificial systems will become the defining skill of humanity's future.

## The Gifts of Leverage

Delegation has historically been the primary leverage strategy of our biology and society. Its benefits are legion, but not necessarily obvious.

The power of delegation lies not just in its immediate efficiency gains, but in its capacity to compound over time, across individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. It is a force that transforms not just what we do, but who we become.

The less obvious rewards of delegation merit careful attention:

### **Transmuting Time**

The greatest impact of delegation often does not lie in the hours saved, but in the almost alchemical transformation of the hours spent elsewhere.

Research suggests that the ability to mentally detach from work is more crucial than the capacity to resist checking email or working during weekends. A study on the impact of organizational expectations for email monitoring after-hours found that "time employees spend on work-related emails after-hours is not the main driver of negative outcomes." Yet, the psychological tether remains. As another study notes, "Overall, these results suggest that \[work-related extended availability\] may pose a threat to \[…\] recuperation, well-being and private lives." It's not the act of responding that drains us, but the cognitive load of knowing we might need to.

Aside from improved quality of time outside of work, the additional focus in the rest of the workday can be transformative—being 100% dialed-in for the afternoon intended for solving a strategic issue can produce radically different outcomes vs. being 85% engaged.

The hour we save in delegating email is nice to have back, but the amplified focus in our other work from not thinking about email is of far greater impact. It is not merely a linear return on the time invested, but an exponential one—for the cognitive mise en place created through delegation enables an entirely different level of performance.

### **Opportunity Cost Arbitrage**

Delegation is a force multiplier on our most valuable human capital. The skilled practice of dividing labor between oneself, other people, and technology is a complex resource optimization problem.

The ROI on time between humans is dramatically asymmetric. Small shifts in the distribution of work can have unpredictable and non-linear returns. Consider the modern CEO. Their time is the organization's most precious resource. When they delegate effectively, they're not simply saving hours; they're reallocating cognitive bandwidth to high-leverage activities that can alter the company's trajectory. A study by Bandiera et al. (2019) found that CEOs who delegate basic email correspondence and calendar management almost exclusively replace these activities with higher-leverage efforts. The implications are profound: a 10% increase in a CEO's focus on strategic initiatives could potentially translate to billions in market capitalization or thousands of jobs created. Even within a smaller company, there can be massively disproportionate returns.

This asymmetry is not an accident of nature, but a fundamental property of human productivity—bell curve distributions in talent can ultimately turn into power-law distributions of outcomes in record sales, patents, market capitalization, academic citations, and so on. As Garicano and Van Zandt noted:

"How does a normal distribution of ability generate such a skewed distribution of income?

The answer… is that it must be the result of a scale of operations effect, through which those with higher ability are assigned more resources. This scale effect affects, in turn, the marginal value of ability."

The implications are clear: those who fail to delegate are not just forsaking short-term leverage—they are committing a sin of omission against the gods of compound returns. The results can ultimately add up in ways beyond imagination, for the arithmetic of delegation is one of exponential rather than linear growth.

### **Talent Development**

The benefits of delegation cascade through the entire organizational hierarchy, and the lion's share accrue beyond the task's originator. Stoker et al. (2022) found that perceived increases in delegation correlated significantly with higher productivity for both managers and their employees. This dual benefit creates a virtuous cycle: as managers delegate more, they become more productive, freeing up time to focus on higher-level strategy, which in turn allows for more effective delegation.

Delegation also serves as a powerful tool for talent development. When leaders entrust subordinates with challenging tasks, they're not just offloading work—they're creating opportunities for growth. This has a compounding effect: as employees develop new skills, they become capable of handling more complex responsibilities, further amplifying the organization's overall capacity.

Moreover, delegation fosters a culture of trust and empowerment. Hanna et al. (2019) found that the act of delegating a task increases subordinate felt trust, which is linked to higher job commitment, satisfaction, and performance. This emotional dividend pays off in reduced turnover, increased innovation, and a more resilient organizational culture.

Ultimately, the process of delegation is one of symbiosis—accruing multifaceted benefits to the principals and agents which extend far beyond mere efficiency. It is a positive-sum game, one in which the pie grows larger for all involved.

### **Positive-Sum Games**

Delegation is not a zero-sum game—it fundamentally expands the pie rather than subdividing it. Failing to appreciate the differences in a zero-sum versus positive-sum game leads to a scarcity mindset and poor decision-making. As Milton Friedman observed in "Free to Choose":

"Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie."

Delegation is not about dividing a fixed amount of work. It's about expanding the pie of what's possible for everyone involved.

The concept of a fixed amount of work, often referred to as the "lump of labor fallacy," is as misleading in personal productivity as it is in macroeconomics. Just as there is no fixed amount of work in an economy, there is no predetermined limit to what an individual can accomplish through effective delegation.

In a similar vein, William Stanley Jevons observed that as the efficiency of coal use increased, counterintuitively, the overall consumption of coal also increased—there was no leveling off, as traditional economics might expect. Jevons' paradox applies at the personal level as individuals unlock greater leverage through delegation. As productivity increases, ambition follows. People exert greater demand upon themselves, and then seek to increase their supply of leverage—typically through delegating more, and more effectively.

More delegation and greater complexity in assigned tasks develops the talent of those involved, enabling greater possibilities as time progresses.

The more the pie is distributed, the larger the pie becomes; the larger the pie becomes, the greater people's appetite and skill in baking bigger and better pies. It is a self-reinforcing cycle of growth, one in which the limits are set not by the size of the pie, but by the imagination and ambition of the bakers.

### **Non-Linear Returns**

As with many complex systems, the benefits of delegation do not manifest linearly. The scope and impact of delegated tasks tends to expand in a J-curve rather than a straight line. Tasks delegated in year two of a longtime client-EA relationship tend to require dramatically less work, involve significantly more complexity, and drive multiples of value in comparison to early delegations.

This non-linear growth is not merely a function of time, but of compounding skill and context. In the course of performing and observing work, the skill of the agent handling the delegated task can expand exponentially, including zero-to-one leaps in new areas or capabilities. The returns expand dramatically, and in many cases, the costs of delegating trend asymptotic to zero—particularly as EA's or other agents can anticipate needs and execute autonomously.

As FDR's secretary Missy LeHand explained,

"I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him … I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it."

As with a top-tier venture capital portfolio, the first year's results provide little context on the final performance. Cognitively unintuitive power laws around the diminishing costs of delegating and its asymptotic returns are hard to appreciate early on, but unmistakable once experienced firsthand. The compounding returns and discontinuities at various stages of delegation skill and agent ability create an evolving pattern of benefit that is often underappreciated and hard to predict.

### **Time Affluence**

The most profound impacts of delegation often manifest outside the workplace. As we offload tasks, we don't just save time—we reclaim mental space. This cognitive unburdening yields dividends in unexpected areas of life.

Research by Whillans, Pow, & Norton (2018) found that "buying time"—essentially delegating household tasks to external service providers in their particular study—significantly enhances relationship satisfaction. This occurs because it protects couples from the negative impact of relationship stress and enables more quality time together. Effective delegation at work can lead to stronger personal relationships and increased life satisfaction as well. Santos et al (2023) determined that after-hours work, particularly email and communication tasks, led to greater internal family conflict as "work–personal life boundaries become less defined and more blurred." The ability to keep these boundaries firm—particularly leaving work at work to prevent its corrosive influence on quality time with family—is a commonly touted benefit of executives with personal assistants.

Time poverty, which effective delegation directly addresses, has been implicated in a staggering array of negative outcomes. From increased probability of divorce to higher incidence of depression and hypertension, the costs of failing to delegate extend far beyond mere inefficiency. Giurge, Whillans, & West (2020) cataloged these impacts, painting a sobering picture of the true cost of cluttered schedules and mental overload.

Yet, the benefits of delegation extend beyond mere time savings. They fundamentally alter how we experience and utilize our time. Mogilner (2018) found that time-saving purchases led to greater happiness than an equal amount spent on material goods. This happiness boost wasn't just about having more free time—it was about the reduced time pressure and increased sense of control over one's life.

This is the paradox of delegation: by relinquishing control over certain tasks, we gain greater mastery over our lives. We transition from being hostage to our to-do lists to architects of our time. The mental bandwidth freed up by effective delegation allows for deeper focus, more immersive presence in social relationships, and better experience in leisure activities.

Time freed by delegation tends to be invested more skillfully than typical discretionary time. Executives who delegate basic email correspondence and calendar management almost exclusively replace these activities with higher-leverage efforts. Non-work time freed by delegation is often invested in under-utilized areas like social interaction with friends and quality time with family—activities correlated with greater happiness and meaning.

In other words, the hour we gain by delegating is much more valuable than a typical hour. And in the end, hours are all we really have.

## The Architecture of Leverage

Delegation is not a simple concept. At its essence, it is the art of exponentially amplifying human potential—a metaphorical philosopher's stone that transmutes the dross of finite hours into the gold of infinite impact. Like any tool of great power, its efficacy hinges on the deftness of its wielder. The returns of delegation have little to do with its quantity, but everything to do with its quality. There is no singular, Platonic Form of delegation; rather, there are varied modes, each involving discrete skills, and yielding wildly divergent patterns of performance and influence.

### **The Delegation Matrix**

In classical depictions, Athena, the Greek Goddess of Wisdom, is rarely portrayed as relying solely on her formidable intellect. Typically, she is armed with both a spear for offense and a shield for defense.

Delegation, as wisdom made manifest, similarly divides into these two categories. The most skilled practitioners seamlessly interlace these approaches, weaving systems that simultaneously shield them from distraction and propel their visions forward with minimal direct intercession.

Defensive delegation is the bulwark against the ceaseless tide of trivial obligations. Far from mere reactivity, it is a proactive aegis, a calculated fortification that preserves precious cognitive bandwidth for higher-order cognition.

Offensive delegation, in contrast, is the vanguard of progress—the deliberate creation and assignment of tasks to achieve strategic objectives.

Both forms are indispensable for reaping the full rewards of delegation. Defense creates the space for offense and cultivates talent that can later be deployed offensively; offense, if rightly pursued, invariably generates new defensive necessities.

Attempting to triage and assign every conceivable task relevant to one's responsibilities and aspirations is a Sisyphean endeavor—an interminable treadmill of enervating decisions. In the quest for greater leverage, one quickly learns to construct systems that allow work to be assigned and progress to be made without oneself as the bottleneck. Whether delegating defensively to protect time, or offensively to pursue goals, the ability to delegate vicariously through others is a sine qua non for maximizing impact.

The intersection of defensive/offensive strategies with direct/vicarious methods yields a four-quadrant matrix of delegation approaches.
Seasoned delegators cultivate an intuitive ability to navigate this matrix, adapting their approach based on the nature of the task, the capabilities of their agents, and the prevailing strategic context.

![][image1]

#### Direct Defensive Delegation

Defensive delegation entails the manual assignment of incoming, predefined tasks and responsibilities.

The quintessential example is tasking an assistant with a scheduling request sent directly to the principal, though this modality extends to far more complex undertakings. A veteran entrepreneur, for instance, might be capable of drafting their own contracts from past templates, yet this is more optimally handled by legal counsel.

Delegating in this fashion does not necessitate a clear vision of how the liberated time will be deployed, or even an understanding of how to execute the task itself. It merely requires a recognition that personally undertaking the task is a suboptimal use of one's time, or carries a lower opportunity cost for others.

#### Direct Offensive Delegation

Offensive delegation is the proactive creation and assignment of tasks in pursuit of strategic objectives.

Unlike defensive delegation, these tasks are not imposed by external parties, but are conceived by the delegator to enlist others in the realization of strategic aims. The specifics of these tasks may be left intentionally ambiguous, allowing for creative latitude in their execution. An offensive delegation might entail directing someone to research a topic, consult a domain expert, or evaluate options before charting a course of action.

One can defend one's time against patently low-value tasks without crystalline clarity about one's ultimate goals. However, such clarity is imperative for effective offensive delegation. Typically, going "on the offensive" involves periodically brainstorming potential actions to advance a well-defined long-term vision, often in collaboration with others (e.g., an executive coach, therapist, or personal trainer).

The shift to an offensive posture represents an ascent beyond mere task reallocation, towards a place of shared vision and distributed executive responsibility. To thrive in this mode, delegators must cultivate the ability to deconstruct the actions required for long-term goal pursuit, and identify which components can be delegated. Equally crucial are the emotional capacity to accept failure, the patience and thoughtfulness to nurture talent, and the skill to assign tasks with the right balance of specificity and open-endedness.

Defensive delegation creates space, both temporally and psychologically, for the principal to advance towards their objectives. Offensive delegation accelerates progress by allowing one to move faster than individual efforts could allow.

#### Vicarious Defensive Delegation

Vicarious _defensive_ delegation entails the assignment of incoming tasks or responsibilities to others, without direct intervention or manual input from the principal.

Delegating every possible task ultimately does not scale. Whether intuitively or intentionally, skilled delegators eventually shift their approach and remove themselves as a bottleneck to task definition and execution. In other words, they delegate delegation itself—they delegate vicariously through people or systems.

Vicarious delegation can manifest in many forms. Clearly communicated roles and responsibilities can empower others to proactively claim tasks, as can well-crafted playbooks or standard operating procedures that codify these processes more rigidly. Software and AI automation can also enable delegation without the principal's direct involvement, such as automatically assigning a task based on the contents of a meeting transcript. Investing in systems that allow for "delegation without delegating" is a hallmark of mastery in this domain. Often, these systems or playbooks emerge organically from the creativity and pattern recognition of the agents themselves, rather than being authored by the delegator. Delegating the creation of defensive delegation systems is a common path to recursive leverage, and to removing oneself as a bottleneck in recurrent workflows.

The skills demanded by vicarious defense are quite distinct from those of direct defense, gravitating more towards systems thinking, human resource management, and strategic planning.

#### Vicarious Offensive Delegation

Vicarious _offensive_ delegation involves the empowerment of others to independently define and assign tasks based on overarching objectives.

Perhaps the most potent form of delegation, vicarious offense gives rise to self-perpetuating engines of progress that operate with minimal oversight. Often, this approach involves delegating only the desired outcome and any pertinent constraints, from which the responsible parties derive their own course of action, for themselves or for others. Unlike direct offensive delegation, the granular tasks are not specified by the original delegator; that onus falls upon the agent charged with achieving the outcome. The principal may be consulted as these plans are formulated and executed, but they are informed rather than responsible for the minutiae of task definition.

As mastery deepens, delegation often becomes multiplayer and recursive, a phenomenon most common in vicarious offensive contexts. An assistant, for example, might independently seek counsel from an external subject matter expert before executing their devised plan. Or, an agent might autonomously assemble and manage a project team, equipped with only a goal from the principal.

As organizations mature, leaders invariably gravitate towards empowering others to pursue well-defined objectives while remaining aloof from the intricacies of execution. A parallel pattern often emerges in the personal lives of seasoned delegators. Longstanding personal assistants evolve into roles variously styled as "chief of staff" or "director of operations for life." In this capacity, they frequently liaise with executive coaches, healthcare professionals, business partners, and other parties to orchestrate elaborate processes in service of their principal's goals—often with the principal themselves having scant awareness of, or involvement in, the granular details.

Delegating offensively through others represents an immense leap in complexity compared to defensive or direct offensive delegation. With each new collaborator added to the web of available resources, the number of potential configurations grows exponentially. Beyond the clarity of vision, communication prowess, and managerial acumen demanded by direct offensive delegation, its vicarious counterpart also requires the systems thinking and game-theoretic strategizing characteristic of defensive vicariousness. The most skilled architects of leverage adopt an almost ecological approach to goal pursuit, perpetually evolving their methods as the capabilities of their network grow, as tools and systems mature, and as the fog of uncertainty around their ultimate destination dissipates.

As a principal's mastery deepens, their delegation becomes decreasingly direct and defensive, and increasingly oriented towards tasks that yield compounding returns.

###

### **Delegation Modalities**

Aside from making distinctions between delegation approaches based on their style, we can consider different forms of delegation based on their contents.

#### Ad Hoc Delegation

The tactical, extemporaneous assignment of individual tasks. Like a shot in the dark, ad hoc delegation lacks the structural underpinnings and lucid objectives of more sophisticated approaches. Yet, it is the requisite point of departure for all who aspire to amplify their efforts through others. The ad hoc delegator navigates their day, opportunistically identifying what can be offloaded to others. Though frequently disorganized and inconsistent, this modus operandi is the primordial ooze from which more evolved forms emerge.

#### Process-Driven Delegation

The systematized assignment of recurrent tasks, predicated on well-defined workflows and standard operating procedures. The process-driven delegator transmutes the ad hoc into the algorithmic, converting one-off tasks into self-sustaining systems. By investing in the creation of playbooks, checklists, and decision trees, they alchemize the pandemonium of incessant delegation decisions into the placidity of a well-oiled machine. This approach excels in stable environments with predictable needs, but can falter when confronted with novelty and flux.

#### Goal-Driven Delegation

The strategic assignment of objectives and key results, empowering agents to autonomously conceive and execute plans. The goal-driven delegator operates at a higher level of abstraction, concerning themselves more with the "what" than the "how." By lucidly communicating desired outcomes and constraints, they engender aligned autonomy—a state in which agents have the latitude to innovate and adapt their approach while still advancing the principal's overarching objectives. This mode of delegation is indispensable for navigating complex, dynamic environments where prefabricated processes rapidly become obsolete.

#### Clairvoyant Delegation

The anticipatory assignment of tasks and objectives, born of deep contextual understanding and predictive acumen. The clairvoyant delegator possesses an almost preternatural ability to foresee needs and opportunities before they manifest. Through a combination of vast experience, intimate familiarity with their principal's goals and proclivities, and keen intuition, they proactively delegate tasks that preempt problems and seize nascent possibilities. This rarefied form of delegation represents the zenith of the craft, transmuting the reactive into the proactive, and the tactical into the strategic.

### **![][image2]**

### **Common Manifestations**

There are a few stylistic forms of delegation which are worth noting. As with a prism, each facet reveals some aspect of the underlying phenomenon.

#### Delegating by Constraint

In the realm of delegation, constraints are often seen as necessary evils—limitations imposed to mitigate risk and ensure alignment. But in the hands of a skilled delegator, constraints become something else entirely: a catalyst for creativity, a call to innovation, a challenge to exceed expectations within well-defined boundaries.

This is the art of delegating by constraints—not by prescribing a precise path, but by defining the contours of the solution space. It's about giving people a problem to solve and the autonomy to solve it, while providing just enough guidance to ensure they don't stray too far off course.

When Steve Jobs tasked his team with designing the first Apple mouse, he didn't dictate the exact dimensions or the precise curvature of the buttons. Instead, he set a simple but powerful constraint: it had to have a single button and cost no more than $15 to manufacture. Within those boundaries, the team was free to innovate, to experiment, to push the limits of what was possible.

This approach harnesses the power of bounded autonomy. It recognizes that people are most engaged and most creative when they have a sense of ownership over their work, when they feel trusted to make decisions and solve problems on their own. But it also recognizes that total freedom can be paralyzing, that a complete lack of structure can lead to chaos and misalignment.

Constraints, when artfully applied, provide just enough structure to channel creative energy in a productive direction. They become a forcing function for efficiency and innovation, a challenge to do more with less. They transform potential distractions into irrelevant noise, allowing the team to focus on what truly matters.

But the art lies in striking the right balance. Constraints that are too loose fail to provide adequate direction, while those that are too tight stifle creativity and breed resentment. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle—constraints that are specific enough to provide clarity, but open-ended enough to allow for creative problem-solving.

When that balance is struck, the results can be extraordinary. Teams that are given bounded autonomy are more engaged, more motivated, and more likely to come up with novel solutions. They take ownership of their outcomes and feel a sense of pride in their achievements.

Moreover, delegating by constraints leverages the diverse perspectives and skills of the entire team. It recognizes that those closest to the problem often have the greatest insight into potential solutions. It taps into the collective intelligence of the organization, transforming leadership from a top-down directive to a collaborative process of aligned autonomy.

In the end, delegating by constraints is about setting the stage for others to excel. It's about providing the direction and resources people need to do their best work, while giving them the freedom to chart their own path. It's a recognition that leadership isn't about having all the answers, but about asking the right questions and creating the conditions for collective success. And in a world of increasing complexity and rapid change, it's an approach that's not just effective, but essential for any organization that wants to stay ahead of the curve.

#### Black Box Delegation

In the traditional view of delegation, the delegator is the expert, the one with all the answers. They parcel out tasks and responsibilities based on a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how to do it. But in a world of rapid change and increasing complexity, this view is becoming increasingly obsolete.

Enter the concept of black box delegation—the art of delegating not just what you know, but what you don't know. It's about venturing into uncharted territory, about entrusting others to solve problems and seize opportunities that lie beyond your current knowledge and capabilities.

At its core, black box delegation is an act of strategic faith, a bet on the potential of your team to rise to the occasion and deliver results, even when—especially when—the path forward is unclear. It's about defining the destination, not the route, and trusting your team to navigate the twists and turns along the way.

Consider the example of a manager tasking their team with exploring a new market opportunity. They don't have all the answers—in fact, they may not even know all the questions. But they know the potential is there, and they trust their team to figure it out.

This isn't a blind leap into the unknown, but a calculated bet. The skilled black box delegator doesn't just throw tasks over the wall and hope for the best. They carefully select the right people for the job, provide clear objectives and parameters, and then give them the autonomy to chart their own course.

It's an approach that requires a high level of trust and a willingness to embrace uncertainty. It means relinquishing control over the specifics of execution and focusing instead on the big picture—the strategic intent, the desired outcomes, the guiding principles.

But when done well, the payoffs can be enormous. Teams that are entrusted with black box delegation are more engaged, more innovative, and more adaptable. They're more likely to come up with novel solutions and to spot opportunities that others might miss.

Moreover, black box delegation is a powerful tool for talent development. It provides opportunities for team members to stretch themselves, to take on new challenges, and to grow in ways that wouldn't be possible under a more prescriptive approach.
Of course, this doesn't mean that failure is not an option. In fact, failure is an inherent part of the process. When you're venturing into the unknown, dead ends and wrong turns are inevitable. But each setback is an opportunity for learning, for refining the approach, for adjusting the course.

The key is to create a culture where failure is seen not as a personal shortcoming, but as a necessary part of the innovation process. It's about celebrating the learnings, not just the successes, and about using each misstep as a stepping stone to greater understanding and more effective action.

In the end, black box delegation is about unleashing the full potential of your team. It's about tapping into the collective intelligence and creativity of the organization, about harnessing the power of diverse perspectives and approaches. It's about creating a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, where everyone is empowered to experiment, to innovate, and to grow. And in a world of constant change and disruption, it's an approach that's not just desirable, but necessary for any organization that wants to stay ahead of the curve.

#### Delegating Mise en Place

In the culinary world, the concept of "mise en place" is sacred. It refers to the meticulous preparation and organization of ingredients and tools before the start of service—everything in its place, ready to be called into action at a moment's notice. It's the foundation upon which the smooth operation of the kitchen depends, the invisible work that enables the visible magic of the meal.

The same principle applies in the world of delegation. Just as a chef relies on a well-prepared mise en place to execute a flawless service, effective leaders delegate the cognitive prep work necessary for peak performance. It's about setting the stage for success, about ensuring that everything is in place for the task at hand.

This involves not just gathering relevant information, but organizing it in a way that facilitates rapid assimilation and action. It's about distilling the essential from the extraneous, about presenting data in a format that aligns with the leader's decision-making style and preferences.

Consider the example of a CEO preparing for a critical board meeting. Rather than spending hours sifting through financial reports and market analyses, they can delegate the task of creating a concise, actionable brief. This allows them to focus their cognitive energy on high-level strategy and decision-making, armed with the essential insights needed to make informed choices.

But delegating the mise en place goes beyond mere information gathering. It's about creating an environment conducive to peak performance. This might involve managing the leader's schedule to ensure uninterrupted focus time, or even optimizing their physical environment for cognitive clarity and creative thinking.

At its core, this form of delegation recognizes that cognitive bandwidth is a precious resource, one that must be carefully managed and allocated. By offloading the preparatory work, leaders free their minds to operate at a higher level of abstraction and creativity. They're able to see patterns and connections that might be obscured by the noise of raw data, to make intuitive leaps that can lead to breakthrough ideas and strategies.

Of course, effective delegation of the mise en place requires a deep understanding of the leader's needs and preferences. It's not just about providing information, but about providing it in the right form, at the right time, and in the right context. It requires a keen sense of what's truly important, and an ability to anticipate needs and potential roadblocks.

When done well, delegating the mise en place creates a virtuous cycle of enhanced performance. Leaders are able to make better decisions faster, which in turn creates more opportunities for delegation and growth. It's a self-reinforcing pattern of effectiveness that separates the truly exceptional from the merely competent.
Moreover, it's an approach that scales. As leaders rise through the ranks and take on ever-greater responsibilities, the ability to effectively delegate the mise en place becomes increasingly critical. It's what allows them to maintain clarity and focus in the face of increasing complexity and demands on their time and attention.

In the end, delegating the mise en place is about creating the conditions for peak performance. It's about recognizing that success is often determined before the first move is made, in the quiet preparation and organization that happens behind the scenes. It's about setting the stage for greatness, and then stepping back to let the performance unfold. And for leaders who master this art, the results can be nothing short of extraordinary.

#### Delegating Skill Acquisition

In the traditional view of delegation, the focus is on getting things done—on parceling out tasks and responsibilities to lighten the leader's load and ensure that work gets completed efficiently and effectively. But there's another dimension to delegation that's often overlooked, one that has the potential to create far more value in the long run. It's the art of delegating not just the work itself, but the ability to learn how to do the work.

This is the alchemy of skill acquisition—the transformative process of turning raw potential into refined capability. It's about hiring experts not just to complete a project, but to serve as mentors and teachers, to impart their knowledge and skills to the internal team. It's about creating a self-sustaining engine of capability development, one that continues to generate value long after the initial engagement has ended.

Consider the example of a startup CEO looking to implement an AI-based recruiting system. Rather than simply hiring a consultant to build the system, they might delegate the task of learning how to build and maintain the system to a high-potential employee. The consultant's role then shifts from mere execution to mentorship and knowledge transfer, from doing the work to teaching others how to do it.

This approach recognizes that the most valuable asset of any organization is its collective intelligence—the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and expertise of its people. By investing in the skill development of team members, leaders create a multiplier effect on organizational capability. They ensure that the organization is not just solving today's problems, but developing the capacity to solve tomorrow's as well.

It's also an approach that recognizes the pace of change in the modern business environment. In a world where technology and market conditions are constantly evolving, the ability to learn and adapt is more important than ever. Delegating skill acquisition ensures that the organization is not just keeping up with change, but staying ahead of it.

Of course, effective skill acquisition delegation requires a keen eye for potential and a willingness to invest in long-term capability development. It means looking beyond immediate task execution to the broader horizon of organizational competence. It requires a shift in mindset from a focus on short-term efficiency to a focus on long-term effectiveness.

But when done well, the rewards are substantial. Teams that are continuously learning are more adaptable, more innovative, and more resilient. They're better equipped to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of the business landscape, to spot opportunities and mitigate risks. They're more engaged and motivated, because they see a clear path for personal and professional growth within the organization.

Moreover, delegating skill acquisition creates a culture of continuous learning and development. It sends a powerful message that the organization values the growth and development of its people, that it's willing to invest in their future. This can be a significant competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent, particularly in industries where skilled workers are in high demand.

In the end, delegating skill acquisition is about creating a learning organization—one that's constantly expanding its capabilities and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's about recognizing that the most important asset of any organization is its people, and that investing in their growth and development is the surest path to long-term success. It's about creating a culture of continuous improvement, where everyone is empowered to learn, to grow, and to contribute to their fullest potential. And for leaders who master this art, the results can be truly transformative.

#### Failure-Accepting Delegation

Delegation is an iterated game, and a long-term perspective is crucial. The skillful investment in delegating to others invariably yields compounding returns over time, but it is far from a linear pathway. The necessary long-game mentality pairs naturally with a satisficer mindset—the understanding that "good enough" in certain areas allows for excellence in others.

Trust is the bedrock upon which all effective delegation is built. Leaders must cultivate an environment where team members feel empowered to make decisions and take calculated risks. This trust must be bidirectional; leaders must also trust their own judgment in delegating tasks and responsibilities.

Due to constant changes in knowledge, environment, technology, and human capabilities, continuous experimentation is essential to maximize value. This implies a pattern more similar to an optimal poker strategy or the growth of a volatile tech stock—there must be some short-term losses in order to maximize long-term gains. Seeking to eliminate mistakes or productivity drawdowns essentially guarantees a suboptimal long-term performance.

Part of the magic of delegation is how it continuously evolves the skill of the delegator and the task's executor. To delegate only tasks where there is 100% confidence in execution eliminates most opportunity for growth, both for the principal and the agent. Just as innovation requires failed experiments to push the boundaries of our knowledge, so too does the leverage in requiring failed delegation to push the boundaries of our collective ability.

The path to mastery in delegation is paved with good intentions and imperfect executions. But it is only through this process of trial and error, of entrusting others with tasks of increasing complexity and ambiguity, that we can truly unleash the exponential power of delegation.

To delegate is to embrace the possibility of failure. But it is also to embrace the possibility of success beyond our individual capacities. It is a leap of faith, but one with the potential for outsized rewards. For our collective capacity of leverage to expand, we must delegate at the hazy perimeter of ability, and accept the potential risks which come with it.

In the end, the greatest risk is not that we delegate and fail, but that we fail to delegate at all. For in a world of infinite possibilities and finite time, the only true failure is the failure to leverage.

#### Recursive Leverage

The true power of delegation lies in its potential for _recursive_ leverage. Both offensive and defensive delegation can be amplified through additional layers of delegation, each adding their own multiplicative effect.

In defensive delegation, a chief of staff (CoS) or trusted executive assistant (EA) might be granted broad authority to handle a wide range of responsibilities, effectively becoming a vicarious delegator for their principal. This creates a shared understanding of the leader's intended time use, freeing them from the cognitive burden of constant task triage.

Delegation the creation of systems that enable vicarious delegation is a common approach toward recursive leverage. This is the art of delegating the creation of leverage assets—the process of designing playbooks, AI agents, software automations, decision frameworks, and other tools that serve as the infrastructure for autonomous execution. The approach here aims to obviate the need for manual delegation in a certain area, which enables greater leverage in others.

Offensive delegation's recursive potential is even more profound. A personal assistant can be empowered not just to execute tasks, but to research and hire experts across various disciplines. These experts, in turn, can define and delegate tasks to other service providers, creating a cascading effect of productive action stemming from a single initial act of delegation.

Effective delegation isn't about creating a linear chain of command; it's about crafting a fractal network of empowered actors and decision-makers, each operating with a clear understanding of the overarching vision but with the autonomy to execute in their sphere of influence.

In the end, recursive delegation is about transcending the limits of individual capacity. It's about leveraging the power of systems and networks to create outcomes that far exceed the sum of their parts.

This recursive leverage explains why some leaders seem to operate on an entirely different plane of productivity and influence. They've mastered the art of creating self-replicating systems of task distribution—removing themselves from the loop by delegating through other people and systems. Novice delegators have but one layer of leverage, but recursive delegation enables infinite layers of leverage.

This approach to delegation doesn't just save time; it creates time. It doesn't merely increase productivity; it redefines what's possible.

Seasoned delegators know that the greatest leverage is not from what you delegate _to_ your assistant, but what you delegate _through_ your assistant.

## Leverage Incarnate

It is impossible to explore the history of human productivity or study the art of delegation without paying special attention to its most powerful manifestation: the long-term personal assistant.

The personal assistant is ubiquitous in the lives of history's most consequential figures. Across disparate fields and eras, great people have wielded this instrument of impact with remarkable consistency. Long-term personal assistants are not just a tool for leverage—in essence, they are leverage incarnate.

Yet, the contributions of these pivotal players often fade into the background of historical narratives. Many great minds invested heavily in overcoming their own deficiencies by relying on more organized individuals, variously called personal secretaries, amanuenses, or valets. The long-term personal assistant brings a unique constellation of attributes that have historically enshrined them as the leverage tool of choice for everyone from Caesar to Newton, Catherine the Great to Steve Jobs.

There are several unique aspects of the leverage delivered by personal assistants which have contributed to their ubiquity in humanity’s great achievements:

### **Alchemy by Specialization**

Economists have long known that the specialization of labor leads to greater productivity. The personal assistant is a specialist par excellence, honing a unique blend of skills tailored to the principal's business and personal priorities. They are the only worker in the economy specialized to the individual, rather than a specific industry or skill. Over years of intimate collaboration, personal assistants become repositories of both explicit and implicit knowledge about their principals. This unparalleled context allows for increasingly nuanced and high-leverage decision-making on the principal's behalf, further conserving their cognitive resources. As Richard Branson remarked of his assistant, "Before I ask her to do something, she can read my mind and know what it is I am thinking before I ask."

Like a portfolio growing through compound interest, the deep specialization of longtime assistants blossoms over time. Each interaction, each task completed, and each decision made adds to the assistant's understanding of the principal's needs, preferences, and strategic vision. Warren Buffett has had the same assistant for over 50 years, and has mentioned her in shareholder letters as she "skillfully assisted me in every aspect of my job." Debbie has been celebrated when she "satisfied the varying needs of the 46 media organizations, \[…\] dealt efficiently with tens of thousands of requests for annual reports and financial information, \[…\] assembled the data for our annual report and oversaw the production and distribution of 165,000 copies." Her specialization is not purely in finance; mentioning her name at Buffett's favorite steakhouse will get you an extra boat of the gravy he loves. Seasoned delegators often note the disproportionate returns of little preferences like that becoming automatic through their longtime assistants. And if there's anyone who knows about the benefits of compound interest, it'd be Buffett.

### **Force Multiplier on the Scarcest Time**

In the economy of human resources, the personal assistant acts as a force multiplier on the principal's time. Consider a technology company CEO—their time and attention are the organization's most precious commodities. By effectively extracting more productive hours from their week, we perform an arbitrage of astounding proportions, trading hours of a typically low-cost resource for the most valuable human resource in the entire enterprise.

Former Cisco CEO John Chambers summarized this dynamic pointedly: "Debbie has always been and continues to be a true business partner; she makes it a point to know the business, what my priorities are and she has the ability to represent me as well as Cisco in the absolute best professional manner." Beyond pinch-hitting for the principal in certain situations, assistants also enable them to perform at their best through creating an ideal cognitive mise en place. As Chambers' assistant describes,

"You'd be nauseated to see what we put together for him. He doesn't really know what he's doing until he goes on the plane. Our teams are constantly putting together materials for him to review."

The personal assistant not only finds more hours in the day for the principal, they enable maximum value extraction from the hours that remain. Unsurprisingly, a detailed economic analysis by Kauppinen (2020) concluded that, in the general case, "it would be wiser to hire \[an\] assistant instead of another manager."

### **Protecting the Attention of Valuable Minds**

Herbert Simon observed that "The abundance of information creates a poverty of attention." The personal assistant serves as a crucial gatekeeper, controlling the flow of information and triaging communications and requests. This protection of the principal's focus enhances the ROI on all other work hours by reducing the cognitive toll of context switching. From Catherine the Great to Jeff Bezos, entrusting the triage and processing of voluminous information to others has been a consistent tactic of those who lead. Safeguarding top performers' attention from an increasingly elaborate array of distractions is key to maximizing productivity for knowledge workers, which Peter Drucker (1999) called "the most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution (whether business or nonbusiness)."

But a skilled personal assistant is not an impenetrable wall against all potential opportunities or communications intended for the principal. Rather, they are a sophisticated semi-permeable membrane, constantly adjusting their filters as needs and priorities evolve. In a study of administrative assistants, Erickson (2017) noted that the best "are proactive – they are running things, blocking some interruptions, slotting others that their experience tells them are important into the flow of the principal's day." Rigidly adhering to a schedule or intended work queue can filter out significant upside, particularly in rapidly-evolving environments. Skilled delegators use assistants as a trained attentional algorithm, empowering them to allow certain disruptions or escalate certain matters—not simply as a barrier to every possible incoming demand.

### **Leverage Commitment Device**

Hiring a personal assistant serves as a powerful commitment device, and strongly biases the principal to focus on high-leverage tasks. It's also a potent social signal of one's dedication to time optimization and impact maximization that often deters would-be interrupters. There is a reason that Einstein referred to his longtime secretary, Helen Dukas, as "my Cerberus." The mere presence of an assistant may deter certain interruptions by serving as an effective signal or barrier to other parties. The additional friction they create against inbound demands upon the principal's time is itself often a sufficient defense to intrusion. From the perspective of the principal themselves, the mere presence of the assistant serves as a constant reminder of the need to hand off lower-impact work.

Some take it a step further than mere reminders. Dwight Eisenhower, whose task management matrix is still in vogue decades after his death, depended on two assistants to align his intentionality. Ann Whitman, his personal secretary, remarked that his appointment secretary would "come in the office and \[point to his watch,\] meaning it's time for you to stop this and go on to something else." On the subject of Ann herself, military historian Stephen E. Ambrose wrote, "that Eisenhower could not have gotten through his tasks without her goes without saying." Ike's famous distinction between the urgent and important matters little without a low-friction way to redirect timely but less vital matters, and Whitman not only helped execute, but also triaged these tasks. Her legion contributions earned her a biography of her own, a rarity for secretaries, and the most voluminous set of presidential records in US history bears her name—not Ike's.

Ultimately, even when a principal clearly defines their optimal use of time, the siren song of low-value tasks and speculative external opportunities can be hard to resist. A personal assistant acts as an extension of the principal's intentions, more effectively safeguarding their use of time against the constant onslaught of distractions and misallocations.

### **Smoothing Spiky Talent Profiles**

In accounts of consequential historic figures' genius and talents, equal ink is often spilled characterizing bizarre personality quirks, counterproductive tendencies, and unexpected skill gaps. The absent-minded scientist inept in managing his personal affairs is one archetype. The disorganized CEO or irascible political leader who struggles to function on their own is another. To maximize the value of these individuals' contributions—and in some cases, to extract any value at all—is only possible through others who serve as a sort of cognitive prosthesis for their various deficits, executive function-related or otherwise.

Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto is widely regarded as one of the greatest game designers of all time. He is credited as the creator of Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, and other franchises which have sold units numbering in the billions. But as David Sheff describes in his 1999 book "Game Over", Miyamoto "was a terrible manager of his division; he needed an assistant to keep everything and everyone organized. Nonetheless, he oversaw all aspects of the creation of the games." Creative genius is vanishingly rare, and it is naive to expect that the few who possess it would also be gifted with supreme organizational abilities, operational acumen, and emotional quotient. From Volatire's Candide to Miyamoto's Legend of Zelda, society has often enjoyed the works of brilliant but chaotic minds largely by virtue of their assistants minimizing their unusual deficits.

Part of Catherine the Great's defining legacy is her reform of Russia's legal code, modernizing the state with Enlightenment ideas. But as biographer Thomas Lowish notes, she "was not confident of her written Russian" and relied on her secretary to "adjust the style of the decree to match the official Russian used in formal proclamations." It is unlikely her legislative accomplishments would be so great without her staff—particularly since she was a German-speaking woman from Poland who wrote the laws in French.

Immanuel Kant is remembered today for maintaining a militaristic personal routine, but this was only true late in his life. His ex-army assistant, Martin Lampe, is largely to credit for facilitating the regimen. Apart from historians of the philosopher's life like Manfred Kühn and Volker Gerhardt, few recall Kant's decades as an avid party-goer and socialite. This is unsurprising, given that these were largely unproductive years. It's no coincidence that Kant wrote the Critique of Pure Reason at 57 years of age, long after Lampe helped enforce a schedule so rigid that neighbors quipped they could set their watch to his daily walks.

Accounts of Newton and Einstein have noted that they would neglect to eat or sleep without the intervention of their assistants, and anecdotes like these are far from few.

Whether filling gaps in skills or character, assistants are often the missing final piece to unlocking the prodigious impact of their counterparts.

### **Bidirectional Work-Life Contributions**

Unlike traditional chief of staff roles or purely work-focused administrative assistants, the personal assistant operates in a more fertile environment for impactful contribution across both professional and personal domains. This holistic approach allows for a more comprehensive optimization of the principal's life and work. A study by Craig & Brown (2017) explored the effect of "contaminated leisure," where the psychological creep of work responsibilities at home was "potentially making the time feel more like work than leisure" for working parents when spending time with their children.

In parallel, the biggest leverage unlock on a person's work output may be fixing an issue outside the office or eliminating responsibilities in one's personal life. The personal assistant is typically the only one who can improve life at home through intervening with the principal's work responsibilities and vice versa. According to his former assistant Naz Beheshti in her book, Steve Jobs delegated to "prioritize his wellbeing," which gave him the "energy and the clarity and the vision to sustain his success and build Apple." Jobs is far from an outlier in this regard.

Momentum can often transfer from progress in personal areas to one's work achievements, or the other way around. Teddy Roosevelt famously preached "the doctrine of the strenuous life," and emphasized that physical training makes us better equipped for cognitive endeavors. His delegation skills were as prolific as his boxing and military prowess; Teddy had his longtime secretary, William Loeb, learn jiu jitsu so he had a sparring partner. Letters and telegrams from Loeb number over 700 in the Theodore Roosevelt Center's catalog documenting his role in handling personal and governmental affairs, including direct guidance to the president himself on navigating political issues. Roosevelt was able to disappear from the White House into the wilderness for weeks at a time due to his skillful utilization of Loeb and others. Today, most business and political leaders lack the delegation systems to embark upon week-plus absences, even when sorely needed for recovery and disconnection. And incidentally, breaks like these may drive benefits far beyond recuperation: Teddy's refusal to shoot a subdued bear on a weeklong hunting expedition during his presidency gave us the term "Teddy Bear." A defining aspect of his legacy was only made possible through delegation; while few recall the Antiquities Act of 1906, children know what to call an ursine plushie even a century later.

The ability to minimize cognitive costs associated with meals, shopping, and other personal obligations is often key to unlocking the greatest production in the office, lab, or studio. For many, eliminating 5-15 hours of stressful administrative work each week can ultimately save a marriage or prevent a life-threatening health risk. The bidirectional impacts between the personal and professional life is an area uniquely addressed by personal assistants, and an oft-cited benefit by seasoned delegators.

## The Hybrid Era of Delegation

Artificial intelligence may ultimately rival the Internet and electricity in its potential to reshape the contours of our culture and economy. Some believe that recent technological developments have created the potential for AI assistants which might deliver the same leverage benefits as human ones (or more).

While the transformative power of cognitive labor performed by machines is indisputable, we must approach this nascent field with a mix of enthusiasm and caution. If adopted without careful consideration, the widespread integration of AI workers—assistants, managers, or otherwise—will have potential harms equal to its potential upside. Coordinating and delegating labor across human and artificial contributors may well be a defining personal and organizational skill of the near future for humanity, both from a productivity and flourishing perspective.

### **The Arc of Innovation**

#### Alloyed Goods

It is crucial to recognize that artificial intelligence, like any technology, is not an unalloyed good in terms of productivity or human labor. History is replete with examples of innovations, such as personal computers, smartphones, and recording devices, that have inadvertently eroded the usage of personal assistants. At first glance, using a device to capture one's thoughts may seem superior to relying on an assistant who cannot be omnipresent. However, this shortsighted perspective fails to account for the invaluable context that assistants absorb through their constant presence, equipping them to tackle more complex and impactful tasks. Throughout the ages, luminaries across diverse fields—from politics to science to art—have relied on personal assistants to take dictation, capture ideas, and handle correspondence. The erosion of this norm by technological advances has simultaneously diminished a fertile training ground for one of the most potent amplifiers of human productivity. This risk is doubly applicable to artificial agents. The most catastrophic mistake would be overeliance on AI assistants, or using them to the exclusion of human assistants, rather than as an augmentation for them.

#### Assembly Lines of Cognition

In the near future, it is virtually certain that more work will be delegated both _to_ and _by_ artificial agents than humans.

While this assertion may initially seem implausible, this is exactly how it has played out with prior technologies. Prior to the Industrial Age, few would have predicted that the majority of engines or common factory goods would be assembled by robots rather than people. Yet, this has indisputably come to pass. Similarly, if you had told accountants in the 1950s that most financial calculations would be performed by spreadsheets rather than humans, many would have responded with incredulity.

The trajectory of artificial agents is both familiar and distinct. It is self-evident that any organization beholden to its shareholders will opt to have an artificial agent perform cognitive tasks typically requiring a skilled and specialized human, provided the output is satisfactory and the cost is significantly lower. Consequently, humans who can deftly organize business processes and assign tasks to a blend of human and artificial workers will possess an immense advantage over those who lack this skill. The performance profiles of human and artificial workers exhibit systematic differences that will likely evolve as technology advances. However, it is improbable that the managerial skills required to optimize the output of an artificial worker will ever perfectly mirror those needed for a human one.

#### Artificial Orchestrators

The more intriguing divergence lies not in the work delegated _to_ artificial agents, but in the work delegated _by_ them. Emerging research by Fügener and colleagues (2021) suggests that even at this early stage, artificial agents are proving to be more effective delegators than their human counterparts. Perhaps more surprising, related work by Hemmer et al (2023) showed that humans prefer the tasks delegated to them by AI than by other human managers.

Several factors may contribute to this unexpected finding. First, artificial agents make more accurate judgments about which tasks can be performed by specific humans or other artificial agents. Second, due to their lower marginal cost of time or computation compared to humans, artificial agents can more consistently include details crucial to task execution. For instance, they can retrieve relevant information from a call transcript or a cloud-stored file, which a human assigning the task may neglect to do or include. Moreover, artificial agents will more reliably adhere to best practices for task delineation, provided this is encoded in their system prompt or enforced through other mechanisms. Finally, AI agents are less likely to elicit negative emotional responses or trigger anxiety in the task recipient. The artificial agent can also be summoned to clarify or check task progress as often as the recipient desires, which would be impermissible for a senior human manager.

#### Theory to Practice

These trends have been validated not only in the literature but also through real-world experimentation. At Athena, we have developed and tested various auto-delegators—artificial agents that delegate on behalf of a human without their intervention. These agents screen emails for potential tasks that can be performed by an artificial or human assistant, creating a task in the project management software and assigning it to the appropriate resource along with all relevant information. We have implemented similar systems for processing call transcripts, ingesting audio from in-person meetings, and assigning tasks from screenshots.

These tools offer two significant advantages. First, they make delegation the default behavior. Humans are not tempted to perform low-value tasks simply because they are immediately accessible and there is time available. In most cases, the task has been delegated, broken into steps, and assigned to an assistant with all relevant information retrieved before the human can even check the email, review the transcript, or attempt the task themselves. The net result is the effective removal of a substantial volume of low-value tasks from high-value or high-skilled workers, eliminating the opportunity for them to misallocate their time on low-leverage activities. In the long term, this likely accelerates the path from more basic to more advanced forms of delegation, alongside preserving the human assistant’s bandwidth for more impactful tasks.

Consistent with the research, we have discovered that human assistants indeed prefer auto-delegated tasks. Not only are the tasks more meticulously crafted and communicated, but a significant portion of the grunt work is often pre-completed by other artificial agents, reducing the risk and burden of task execution. For example, if a phone transcript implies an agreement to purchase a flight on a specific day, an artificial agent can surface the best flights aligned with the principal's preferences and add them to the task for the human assistant to review. This saves the human assistant time and reduces the likelihood of booking a flight that conflicts with the preferences or requirements discussed on the call.

#### Assistants Past and Future

The exemplars of human assistant utilization throughout history offer instructive lessons for their imminent artificial counterparts. For both artificial and human assistants, context is the primary constraint. The instructions given by skilled delegators in the past bear a striking resemblance to current best practices for prompt design in AI agents and large language models. These instructions often specified where necessary context should be retrieved. For instance, Catherine the Great directed her secretary to read her notes on Enlightenment legal texts and research laws from Western Europe, which were then used to rewrite Russian laws. Her written instructions to her assistant read like an example of prompt engineering from OpenAI or Anthropic. There is likely a great deal to be gained in adapting time-tested approaches with human assistants in the design of artificial ones.

The bottlenecks with AI assistants today often stem from an inability to delegate or a lack of crucial context, rather than deficiencies in the models' intelligence. Many business leaders struggle to delegate effectively even to highly experienced and specialized humans who possess extensive context about their organization, processes, and goals. It is unlikely that they would fare much better working with artificial agents, which are frequently hampered by fragmented data sources, incomplete context, or poor instruction and goal definition. However, AI does present certain opportunities for humans to delegate beyond their innate capability, provided they attain a minimum threshold of skill.

### **AI Delegation Modalities**

As we delve deeper into the age of artificial intelligence, the landscape of delegation is undergoing a profound metamorphosis. AI is not merely augmenting our ability to delegate; it is revolutionizing the entire process, from task inception to execution and feedback. This paradigm shift is expanding the horizons of what is possible in personal and professional productivity.

### **![][image3]**

#### Delegation Enhancement

The first wave of AI-enhanced delegation focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of the delegation process itself. This enhancement manifests in several key areas:

1. Reformatting for Clarity: AI's natural language processing capabilities allow it to convert messy or rambling voice notes into clear, actionable task descriptions. This ensures that delegated tasks are well-defined from the outset, reducing misunderstandings and improving execution.

2. Intelligent Resource Attachment: By leveraging its ability to process and connect vast amounts of information, AI can automatically find and attach relevant resources to delegated tasks. Whether it's locating a mentioned Google Doc or retrieving contact information for a listed person, AI streamlines the process of gathering necessary information.

3. Proactive Risk Mitigation: AI systems can analyze task descriptions and flag potentially missing requirements or details that could hinder task execution. This proactive approach to risk management helps prevent bottlenecks and ensures smoother task completion.

4. AI as Co-Pilot: In real-time scenarios such as quarterly reviews, calendar audits, or ideation sessions, AI can work synchronously with the delegator. Moreover, AI can co-write delegations in task management systems, offering contextual autocompletion and suggestions to enhance the quality and completeness of task descriptions.

#### Automating Delegation

Moving beyond enhancement, AI is now capable of identifying and initiating delegation autonomously:

1. Email Autodelegation: AI can scan incoming emails, identify stated or implied tasks, and automatically create corresponding items in a task manager. This ensures that no action items slip through the cracks amidst busy inboxes.

2. Call and Meeting Autodelegation: By analyzing call or meeting transcripts, AI can extract action items and commitments, translating them into task manager entries without manual intervention.

3. Visual Autodelegation: AI's image recognition capabilities allow it to identify tasks from screenshots, screen recordings, or other media, extracting and assigning corresponding tasks.

4. Log-Based Autodelegation: AI can process raw logs of system activity, such as focused application windows, browser tabs, API calls, and their corresponding contents, and then process these with user context. This will allow an experience like text autocompletion but at the task level, which can involve assignment to either AI agents or humans chosen from available resources.

#### AI Delegation Co-Piloting

Perhaps the most transformative aspect of AI in delegation is its ability to proactively suggest tasks for delegation:

1. Goal-Based Suggestions: By understanding a client's goals, preferred strategies, and context, AI can suggest tasks for executive assistants that align with overarching objectives. This approach ensures that delegation is always strategically aligned.

2. Activity-Based Suggestions: Through analysis of current actions, previously delegated tasks, and relevant context (potentially drawing from APIs, activity logs, or screen recordings), AI can identify tasks that could or should be delegated, promoting more effective time management.

3. Media-Based Suggestions: In a process akin to mimetic learning, AI can review various media forms (articles, podcasts, videos, books) and identify strategies that can be adapted into an EA-forward approach. This "René Girard Autodelegator" expands the horizons of delegation by drawing inspiration from diverse sources.

#### AI Feedback and Coaching

The final frontier of AI-enhanced delegation lies in its ability to provide feedback and coaching:

1. Tactical Improvement: AI can review delegated tasks and suggest improvements, continually refining the delegation process.

2. Standardization Opportunities: By identifying related delegations, AI can suggest areas ripe for conversion into playbooks or clarification through guidelines, promoting consistency and efficiency.

3. Gap Identification: AI can flag areas where delegation is not occurring, highlighting potential opportunities for increased productivity.

4. Upskilling and Advancement: AI can identify areas where executive assistants can expand their responsibilities, suggesting resources for skill development or identifying potential external experts or contractors to engage.

5. Automation and Process Improvement: By analyzing recurring tasks, AI can suggest automation opportunities or ways to streamline processes, further enhancing overall productivity.

The integration of AI into the delegation process represents a symbiotic relationship that expands the realm of possibilities far beyond the confines of traditional human-only delegation. By enhancing every facet of delegation—from task identification to execution and feedback—AI is not merely improving efficiency; it is redefining the very essence of what can be accomplished through effective delegation.

### **The Future of Leverage**

As we approach an inflection point where nearly every person on Earth will have access to zero-cost cognitive labor, delegation will emerge as the most essential discipline in shaping our future. Imagine if, during the Industrial Revolution, every member of the workforce had access to their own gigafactory staffed with an unlimited supply of free line workers. In such a scenario, knowledge of each station on the assembly line would be of little consequence. Insight into factory design, workforce organization, and systems-building would be far more crucial. Strategic expertise in determining what the factory should produce, how to respond to shifting market conditions, and other high-level decisions would be the key drivers of success. In short, the skills of the orchestrator, rather than the instrumentalist, would reign supreme.

We are on the cusp of this exact scenario in the realm of knowledge work. When nearly everyone has access to free cognitive labor that rivals human experts in capability, the skill of organizing this infinite workforce will be the ultimate differentiator. What you delegate and how you delegate it will be the sole factors distinguishing you from those with access to the same unlimited artificial labor force (and its dramatically more productive human counterpart).

And it is clear that AI will not solely be a worker in this future hybrid organization, but also a manager and advisor—on the giving end delegation, not just the receiving end.

Nicholas Bloom and colleagues (2024) put forth the notion that management itself is "akin to a technology"—one that can account for dramatic differences in productivity between companies and nations. Intuitively, this makes sense; most companies and nations have access to the same basic technologies, so it is the skill in wielding them that drives the end result. The conclusions are self-evident, even without the authors' rigorous econometric analysis: "the need to coordinate a multitude of dispersed agents within a ﬁrm is critical," and the better we understand these dynamics, the more we can "increase the aggregate wealth of nations."

The differences between firms and countries who differ in management or delegation aptitude are stark, and these gaps will almost certainly be multiplied as artificial agents enter the equation.

The management science of the hybrid workforce has yet to be written, but there is no version of the future where it will not be essential to our species' success. The faster this knowledge is developed and the more widely it is disseminated, the brighter that future will be.

Those who excelled at the management and design of human organizations defined the fate of companies and nations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Those who excel at the architecture of human-AI organizations and delegation of labor within them may well control the fate of the species moving forward.

## Maximizing Human Delegation

Delegation has delivered humanity’s greatest victories and innovations, yet it occurs with tragic infrequency.

Untold hours of each generation’s greatest minds are wasted on mundanities like scheduling, and even skilled work that others can do equally well (or better).

For every Immanuel Kant, who finally created their masterwork after hiring the perfect assistant, there are likely hundreds or thousands of would-be Kants.

In some other universe, there was a da Vinci who created 200 or 2000 paintings rather than the 20 which we enjoy. At least we have his notebooks, thanks to the heroic cataloging and translation efforts by his assistant, Francecso Melzi.

As history has shown, our great works of art, life-saving inventions, and society-shifting technologies will materialize based largely on how well their creators delegate.

To maximize human progress and flourishing, we must drive maximal delegation by eliminating its historic barriers.

This campaign must be waged on multiple fronts:

### **Restoring the Social Norms of Greatness**

We must correct the misconceptions about great contributors working in isolation. This isn't merely about historical accuracy; it's about providing symbolic permission for today's talents to follow the best practices of history's most impactful figures.

When students learn of Cicero, they study his rhetoric and historical impact, but likely assume he achieved everything alone. Cicero's brilliant statesmanship, oratory, and writing was enabled by prolific utilization of his assistant, Tiro. In reality, his acumen in delegation is as much a part of his legacy—and perhaps even greater in skill—than his other talents. It's far easier to shape the political discourse of your era when someone else is handling your finances, writing letters on your behalf, managing real estate, organizing your library, taking dictation, playing the role of editor, and serving as a point person on both personal and professional relationships. And ironically, while Cicero's political philosophy has become outdated as new thinkers on governance contributed to humanity's knowledge, his skillful delegation of personal affairs is as relevant today as it was during the reign of Julius Caesar.

We know the great Roman rhetorician is not unique in this aspect. Far too much emphasis is placed on the what rather than the how of history's great achievements. For almost every Cicero, there is a Tiro. For almost every first flight, there is a Charlie Taylor. And for almost every CRISPR, there is a Lindsey Billups. Whether directly contributing to the work or enabling the space for it, assistants have long been the co-authors of the great works in our annals.

The lion's share of history has been achieved through delegation. The better this is understood, the better off we'll be. The authors of the future will bring about humanity's next great achievements more quickly and with greater ease if they replicate the true secret of our success—not a historically inaccurate, overly romanticized, do-it-all-yourself version which is doomed to underachieve.

### **Codifying the Praxis of Delegation**

Delegation is a complex cognitive, emotional, and social constellation of skills. It is not a single tactic or workflow to be acquired in a one-day workshop or a single book. Though some have a greater natural talent for delegation, its mastery is not innate but learned. We must accelerate this learning process, documenting specific methods for productive assistance that are often learned only by painful trial and error. Many of the best didactic approaches will involve realtime co-piloting or near-instant feedback enabled by artificial intelligence.

As we approach an inflection point where nearly every person on earth will have access to zero-cost cognitive labor, delegation will become the most essential discipline in crafting our future.

Imagine if during the Industrial Revolution, every person in the workforce had access to their own gigafactory staffed with unlimited free line workers. In such a scenario, knowledge about each station on the assembly line would matter little. Insight around factory design, workforce organization, and systems-building would be far more important. So would strategic expertise in knowing what the factory should build, how to react to changing markets, and so on. In short, the skills of the orchestrator rather than the instrumentalist would be the driver of success.

We are nearing the arrival of this exact scenario for knowledge work. When nearly everyone has access to free cognitive labor on par with human experts, it is the skill of organizing this infinite workforce which will matter most. What you delegate and how you delegate it is all that will differentiate you from those with the same unlimited artificial labor force (and its dramatically more productive human counterpart).

Nicholas Bloom and colleagues (2024) advanced the notion that management itself is "akin to a technology"—one which can explain dramatic differences in productivity both between companies and nations. Intuitively, this makes sense; most companies and nations have access to the same basic technologies, so it is skill in wielding them which drives the end result. The conclusions are obvious even without the authors' rigorous econometric analysis: "the need to coordinate a multitude of dispersed agents within a ﬁrm is critical," and the better we understand these dynamics, the more we can "increase the aggregate wealth of nations."

The management science of orchestrating human and artificial team members has yet to be written, but there is no version of the future where it will not be essential to our species' success. The faster this knowledge is developed and the more widely it is distributed, the brighter that future will be.

Those who pioneer the art of delegating across human and machine will have a disproportionate role in shaping our collective destiny.

### **Building Talent Marketplaces & Matchmaking**

New marketplaces have driven rapid changes in delegation across the global population. Ride-sharing, food delivery, and freelance platforms have reduced informational and execution frictions, established trust, and minimized downside risk for consumers. The same has been true for enterprises with gig economy platforms—delegation has become more frictionless with richer context on hireable talent, guarantees around performance, and minimized logistics in outsourcing internationally.

These marketplaces reduce the barriers to delegation dramatically. Individuals and businesses need not vet workers, craft labor contracts, or spend resources on identifying talent—whether it's to deliver dinner or code software. The more marketplaces there are, and the more easily they're connected, the more efficiently labor can be distributed.

We must continue to innovate in this space, creating more efficient markets for cognitive labor in particular. More elaborate marketplaces of human and artificial talents can maximize productivity while minimizing cost inefficiencies typically incurred with full-time and part-time employees. The perfect resource hired for the exact modicum of work needed is no longer an economic fantasy, but an increasingly realistic option in scaling organizational productivity outside the bounds of its full-time members.

These marketplaces must evolve beyond simple listings of resumes or profiles to more intelligent systems that can proactively suggest optimal talent for specific tasks, projects, or goals. AI can play a crucial role here, analyzing vast amounts of data on worker skills, preferences, and performance to make highly personalized recommendations. By reducing the search and transaction costs associated with finding the right talent for the job, these AI-powered marketplaces can dramatically increase the frequency and quality of delegation.

Moreover, these platforms must go beyond one-off transactions to foster long-term relationships and skill development. They should provide tools for performance tracking, feedback, and coaching, allowing workers to continuously improve their skills and delegators to refine their delegation strategies. By creating an environment of mutual growth and learning, these marketplaces can elevate delegation from a transactional necessity to a transformative practice.

### **Pioneering Delegation Technologies**

Technology can address two major barriers to delegation: not knowing what or how to delegate, and facilitating the delegation process itself. AI tools can identify delegation opportunities from goals, even when the delegator is a novice or has limited bandwidth. They can reduce communication effort, make delegation a default behavior, and facilitate context development for external parties. AI can delegate on people's behalf, and typically with greater skill than humans (according to human raters, across multiple studies). As noted by Candrian & Scherer (2022), AI can reduce humans' errors involving "inefficient delegation choices, over-monitoring, and under-delegation that can lead to poor(er) decisions and thus give rise to harmful economic consequences."

These technologies must go beyond mere task assignment to encompass the full lifecycle of delegation. They should provide tools for task definition, context sharing, progress tracking, and performance evaluation. By automating the mundane aspects of delegation, these technologies can allow humans to focus on the higher-level strategic and creative aspects.

Moreover, these technologies should be designed with the understanding that delegation is not a one-size-fits-all process. They should adapt to individual preferences, communication styles, and working habits. By providing a personalized delegation experience, these tools can help overcome the psychological barriers that often prevent people from delegating effectively.

Ultimately, the goal of these technologies should not be to replace human judgment, but to augment it with cognitive prostheses. They should provide insights and recommendations, but leave the final decisions to the human delegator. By striking the right balance between automation and human control, these technologies can help us harness the power of delegation without losing the benefits of human intuition and creativity.

### **Expanding Access to Personal Assistants**

The impact of individuals and organizations follows a power law distribution. Einsteins, da Vincis, and Steve Jobses are few. Ensuring that as many high-impact individuals as possible have access to skilled personal assistants can lead to outsized returns for society. Moreover, ensuring potential future talents are matched with high-quality assistants can increase the likelihood of a would-be Newton or Curie becoming the actual next Newton or Curie.

But access to personal assistants should not be limited to the already successful or the potentially great. Every individual has unique talents and contributions to make, and delegation can help them unlock their full potential. By democratizing access to personal assistants, we can create a rising tide that lifts all boats.

This will require innovative business models and technologies that can scale the personal assistant relationship beyond the one-to-one paradigm. Shared assistant services, AI-powered assistants, and delegation marketplaces can all play a role in making personal assistants more accessible and affordable.

Moreover, we need to reframe the personal assistant relationship as not just a luxury for the elite, but a necessity for anyone looking to maximize their impact. By changing the cultural narrative around personal assistants, we can encourage more people to seek out and benefit from these relationships.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a world where everyone has access to the support they need to thrive and maximize their impact. Where delegation is not a rare skill possessed by a select few, but a universal tool for unlocking human potential. Where the question is not whether you have an assistant, but how you can best work with your assistant to achieve your goals and contribute to the world.

Artificial intelligence tools may have a powerful role in augmenting the productivity of humanity’s next great achievers, but it is not certain when—or if—these assets might eclipse the power of assistants like Augustus’, Newton’s, and Jobs’. It is a safer bet for the near-term that human assistants will continue to play a critical role in the species’ next great creations, and more likely that they will be utilizing, managing, and coordinating with AI than be replaced by them. Leveraging AI to augment the time-tested impact of personal assistants and broaden their availability is a priority in maximizing the output of our species’ next era of creators, inventors, and leaders.

## Coda

### **The Call to Leverage**

We stand at a unique inflection point in the history of progress. The rapidly maturing tools at our disposal—global talent marketplaces, the atomization of labor, and artificial intelligence—have the potential to unlock human potential at an unprecedented scale.

But this revolution will not happen by itself. It requires a conscious effort to reshape our understanding of productivity, collaboration, and human potential. These powerful tools will not wield themselves, nor instruct us in their use.

The future belongs to those who can harness the power of delegation, not just for personal gain, but for the advancement of our entire species. To paraphrase a manifesto of a different era: Delegation must be a relentless assault on the forces of the unknown, compelling them to yield before human potential.

We are living in accelerationist times, and the eras of incremental improvements are long past. As progress becomes more rapid, minor errors in direction are amplified. The engines which propel us into the future must be carefully oriented.

We must embrace delegation not as a mere skill, but as a philosophy—a lens through which we view the human and artificial worlds, recognizing the finitude of our personal assets and their limitless potential when skillfully multiplied.

History has always been written by those who used their own talents and effort as just a small component in their arsenal of impact.

The future will be no different.

And to those who wish to author it:

It's time to delegate.

## Epilogue

### **The Delegated Manifesto**

### **The ~~Delegation~~ Delegated Manifesto**

It would undermine the spirit of this essay to have written it personally.

The reader deserves candor, and each contributor deserves acknowledgement—biological or otherwise.

A human executive assistant collaborated with various AI assistants on identifying historical figures and primary source materials of interest, such as biographies and collections of letters. The EA helped obtain the material, as well as create certain AI workflows to extract their content.

Essentially, an AI assistant read the biographies for us. The EA fact-checked the extracted quotations to de-risk potential hallucinations.

The same is true of quotations from academic papers and other references.

We wish we had time to read each one—they all seem very interesting.

The graphics were a human and artificial team effort.

Your author wrote the introduction and conclusion, left voice notes which were transcribed and expanded by other AI tools, sourced writing samples to include in prompts to the large language models, and did an editorial pass on the final draft.

We sincerely hope this material inspires the reader to delegate, build systems that enable delegation, and maximize the impact of themselves and others.

More importantly, we intend for this writing to itself empower vicarious delegation in spreading and operationalizing its message. At this point, you should know what to do.

## Glossary

Defensive delegation: The process of handling and assigning tasks that have already been identified and typically assigned to you through various channels such as email or meetings. These tasks exist within the framework of your established responsibilities.

Offensive delegation: A proactive approach to task management where tasks are created and assigned based on broader goals or objectives, rather than in response to specific assignments. This type of delegation involves identifying unmet needs or opportunities to achieve strategic goals.

Direct delegation: The manual assignment of tasks where you personally handle the task identification and assignment process. This involves directly communicating tasks to team members, subordinates, or AI agents.

Vicarious delegation: The process of delegating tasks indirectly through systems or intermediaries, reducing your active participation in the assignment process. This can involve empowering assistants to hire and manage other personnel, creating a system or playbook for tasks to be handled without one’s direct intervention, or leveraging an AI agent to triage/assign tasks or suggest potential actions.

Delegation by task: Also known as ad hoc delegation, this involves assigning individual tasks manually as they arise. This can be done through various modalities such as text messages, emails, task management software, or even audio and video communications.

Delegation by process: Also referred to as process-driven delegation, this involves assigning recurring tasks or workflows and accountability for an associated outcome. It can be based on time-based recurrence (e.g., monthly invoicing) or rules-based recurrence (e.g., creating a note when booking a flight). It often involves the development and management of playbooks or standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Delegation by goal: A form of delegation where areas of responsibility or specific goals are assigned rather than individual tasks. This involves creating shared expectations and heuristics, allowing the delegate to proactively identify and execute tasks that contribute to the given goals.

Clairvoyant delegation: An advanced form of delegation where the delegate not only executes assigned tasks but also proactively executes unassigned tasks. This can also extend to autonomously suggesting improvements, creating processes, or extending/modifying goals. Includes both defensive (need-driven) and offensive (goal-driven) approaches to proactive task execution, often involving high levels of autonomy and strategic thinking which aims to mimic the intent of the principal.

Delegation by Constraints: A method of delegating tasks by specifying limitations or requirements rather than providing explicit instructions.

Recursive Delegation: A process where delegation occurs in a nested or hierarchical manner, with each person/AI agent delegating to another.

Task delegability: The extent to which a task can be effectively assigned or transferred to another entity (human or AI).

Lubars & Tan (2019) and Cvetkovic & Bittner (2022).

AI delegation:

AI to Human: The process by which AI agents assign tasks or decisions to humans.

Hemmer et al (2023).

Human to AI: The process of humans assigning tasks or decisions to AI agents.

Pinski et al (2023).

Time affluence: The perception of having sufficient time to engage in personally meaningful activities and pursue one's goals without feeling rushed.

Kasser et al (2009).

Time poverty/famine: A state where individuals feel they don't have enough time to meet their basic needs or engage in activities they value.

Perlow (1999) and Giurge et al (2020).

Ataraxia: A state of serene calmness and freedom from emotional disturbance and anxiety, often associated with Epicurean philosophy.

Recursive leverage: The idea of using a tool or process to improve itself, creating a cycle of continuous enhancement.

Cognitive prostheses: Tools or technologies that extend or enhance human cognitive abilities.

Lieder et al (2019).

Polanyi's Paradox: The observation that humans often have more implicit knowledge than explicit knowledge about their preferences or performance of cognitive tasks, highlighting the challenge of automating certain human skills or enabling AI agents to achieve human-like behavior or performance.

Autor (2014).

Moravec's Paradox: Phenomenon representing the surprising difficulty and high failure rates when AI systems perform tasks that are simple for humans, despite being capable of superhuman performance at more complex tasks. Examples include large language models failing at basic reasoning and mathematics despite possessing enormous quantities of historical and scientific facts or being capable of generating text at rates beyond human capabilities.

Jevon's Paradox: An economic theory which posits that as technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, the rate of consumption of that resource tends to increase rather than decrease. This occurs because improved efficiency lowers the relative cost of using the resource, which generally leads to increased demand and consumption.

Lump of Labor Fallacy: The mistaken belief that there is a fixed amount of work to be done in an economy, which can lead to misguided conclusions about the impact of technology on employment. This fallacy often arises in discussions about automation and job displacement, ignoring the potential for new job creation and economic growth as a result of technological advancements.

Comparative advantage: The ability of an individual or entity to carry out a particular economic activity more efficiently than another activity, relative to competitors.

Opportunity cost minimization: The strategy of choosing options that result in the lowest foregone value of alternatives not chosen.

Metacognition: Awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes and learning strategies.

Metaknowledge: The awareness and understanding of one's own knowledge, including its limits and reliability. In AI contexts, it influences how AI systems interact with humans of varying competence levels, and is crucial for effective human-AI collaboration and decision-making. Also entails knowledge about how/where to find information, e.g. in a RAG system or agentic research workflow.

Fugener et al (2024).

Cognitive load: The total amount of mental effort being used in working memory.

Sweller (1994), Brachten et al (2020).

Principal agent theory (PAT): A theory that deals with the difficulties in motivating one party (the agent) to act on behalf of another (the principal) when their interests and access to information may not be perfectly aligned.

Algorithmic governance: The use of algorithms and artificial intelligence in decision-making processes, particularly in public administration and policy-making.

Human-in-the-loop: A model of interaction where a human is involved in a system's operation, often to supervise, intervene, or make critical decisions.

Zanzotto (2019).

Explainable AI: AI systems that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decisions or outputs. Influences human perception and trust regarding AI outputs or decisions.

Human-AI Complementarity: The synergistic combination of human and artificial intelligence capabilities to achieve outcomes superior to either working independently.

Bounded rationality: The idea that human rationality is limited by cognitive constraints, available information, and time when making decisions.

Default bias: The tendency for people to prefer or choose pre-set options or the status quo when making decisions.

Availability bias: A cognitive bias where people overestimate the likelihood of events with greater "availability" in memory, which can be influenced by how recent, vivid, or emotionally charged these memories may be.

Yerkes-Dodson Law: A psychological principle suggesting that performance increases with physiological stress or mental arousal, but only up to a point, after which performance decreases.

Wundt Curve: A concept in psychology describing the relationship between stimulus intensity and hedonic response, suggesting that pleasure increases with intensity up to a point, then decreases as novelty wears off.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique in natural language processing that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

Agency Theory: A management and economic theory that deals with relationships where one party (the principal) delegates work to another (the agent).

Disembodied cognition: The concept that cognitive processes can occur independently of physical embodiment, often discussed in the context of artificial intelligence.

Functional specialization: The idea that different areas of the brain are specialized for particular functions or types of processing, and may become more specialized over time through evolution.

Ego depletion: The hypothesis that self-control or willpower is a limited resource that can be exhausted, leading to reduced capacity for further self-regulation.

Baumeister et al (1998)

Procedural memory: A type of long-term memory that is responsible for knowing how to do things, also known as motor skills.

Episodic memory: A type of declarative memory that involves the recollection of specific events, situations, and experiences.

Chunking: A process by which individual pieces of information are bound together into a meaningful whole, often used as a memory technique.

Modality effect: The finding that the presentation format of information can affect how well it is processed and remembered.

Knowledge representation and reasoning: The field of AI concerned with representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks.
