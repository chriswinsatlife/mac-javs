# **SLIDE STORYBOARD — “Delegation: The Transfer of Judgment Across Generations”**

### **Slide Layout Overview (PowerPoint / Google Slides)**

**Slide Ratio:** 16:9
**Design Intent:** A single elegant image-based timeline; minimal text; emotional silence between eras.
**Goal:** Show that the principle of delegation — _the transfer of judgment_ — is timeless.

## **VISUAL STRUCTURE**

**Top Title (centered):**

**Delegation: The Transfer of Judgment Across Generations**

### **MAIN BODY (Two-Column Split Layout)**

#### **Left Column – 1960s: IBM**

- **Image:** Archival black-and-white photo of Thomas J. Watson Jr. at IBM headquarters or System/360 launch.
  (Optional: subtle background texture of punch cards or early computer panels.)

- **Quote (centered over photo, in white text or muted cream):**

    “If I have to make every decision,
    I’ve failed to build a company that can think.”
    — _Thomas J. Watson Jr., IBM (1960s)_

#### **Right Column – 2010s: Microsoft**

- **Image:** Color photo of Satya Nadella addressing a Microsoft all-hands or developer event.
  (Cool blue/azure tones with modern tech energy.)

- **Quote (centered over photo):**

    “Our job isn’t to be know-it-alls,
    but learn-it-alls.”
    — _Satya Nadella, Microsoft (2010s)_

### **Connecting Element (Centerline)**

- A **thin golden horizontal line** connecting the two images, symbolizing continuity of principle.
- At midpoint, a subtle gear-like or neural-network icon labeled **“Transfer of Judgment.”**

### **Bottom Takeaway Box (Full Width, White or Minimal Background)**

**Text (centered, minimal):**

Delegation isn’t the transfer of tasks —
it’s the **transfer of judgment**, anchored in context, priorities, and trust.

Watson built a company that could **think.**
Nadella built a company that could **learn.**

_That’s the true measure of leadership — how well your judgment survives your absence._

---

## **SPEAKER SCRIPT (90 seconds total)**

_(Use the slide as a visual anchor — no text read verbatim.)_

“Half a century apart, Thomas Watson Jr. at IBM and Satya Nadella at Microsoft faced the same leadership problem — how to scale judgment without losing control.

Watson realized that if every decision ran through him, IBM could never think for itself. He began transferring not just work, but _judgment_ — context, priorities, and trust. That’s what produced the System/360 — a billion-dollar risk made possible by leaders who could think as he did.

Fifty years later, Nadella found Microsoft paralyzed by hierarchy and fear of mistakes. He told his teams, _‘Our job isn’t to be know-it-alls, but learn-it-alls.’_

He replaced control with curiosity — building a system where better thinking could scale faster than his own decisions.

That’s what real delegation is.
It’s not losing control.
It’s designing a system where your best judgment endures — even when you’re not in the room.”

### **Visual Footer (Center, Minimalist Tagline):**

_Every hour you delegate is an hour you reinvest in what only you can do._
— Athena Operating Principle

---

## **🎙️ Speaker Script (≈2 minutes)**

“When people first hear the word ‘delegation,’ they often think about tasks.
But the real journey of delegation is transformation — from deleting friction to designing a life that scales your judgment and values.

At the most basic level, it starts with **relief** — deleting annoyances that drain energy: holding, checking out, managing subscriptions. You reclaim time just by cutting friction.

Then comes **design** — owning your day with intention. Your inbox, your calendar, your workouts — all pre-structured for clarity and focus.

As you move forward, you **systemize** — running your life like a hotel. Everything restocks, runs, and renews without your supervision.

Then you **multiply** — using delegation not just to save time but to expand impact: hosting, hiring, learning, leading.

And finally, the highest level — **reinvention**.
When delegation becomes not just operational but existential. Your systems protect your energy, deepen your relationships, and allow you to live as the next version of yourself.

That’s not outsourcing. That’s _operating differently._
Every hour you delegate becomes an hour you reinvest in what only you can do.”

# The delegation system

# **The Delegation System: From Tasks to Judgment**

---

### **Visual Layout (16:9, Three Horizontal Bands)**

Each band represents a layer of the system — **Spectrum**, **Structure**, and **System** — moving from _theory_ to _practice_.
The visual flow reads top-to-bottom, with a subtle gradient from steel gray → blue → gold, symbolizing increasing autonomy and judgment.

---

#### **🩶 I. The Spectrum: How Delegation Matures**

_(Visual: thin horizontal continuum with four nodes — Task → Process → Objective → Judgment.)_

| Level         | Focus   | Delegation Style                              | XP Autonomy   |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Task**      | Steps   | “Do this exactly this way.”                   | 🔒 Low        |
| **Process**   | SOP     | “Follow the standard way we do this.”         | ⚙️ Moderate   |
| **Objective** | Outcome | “Here’s the goal — decide how.”               | 🔓 High       |
| **Judgment**  | Context | “Here’s the intent — use your best judgment.” | 🧭 Full Trust |

**Key Idea (caption):**

The goal isn’t to delegate work — it’s to delegate _thinking._

---

#### **🔵 II. The Structure: Two Languages of Delegation**

_(Visual: two side-by-side boxes connected by a gold line labeled “Mature Systems Use Both.”)_

| Dimension   | SOP (Task-Based)                      | Protocol (Objective-Based)                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose** | Ensure consistency                    | Enable judgment                                                    |
| **Focus**   | How to execute                        | When / Why to act                                                  |
| **Example** | “Book travel using Concur by Friday.” | “If a flight cancels, rebook within 90 min; escalate if over $2K.” |
| **Goal**    | Efficiency                            | Empowerment                                                        |

**Key Idea (caption):**

SOPs protect quality; Protocols protect judgment.
The shift from SOP → Protocol is the shift from _doing_ to _leading._

---

#### **🟡 III. The System: How It Scales**

_(Visual: overlapping circles labeled “Execution Library (SOPs)” and “Judgment Library (Protocols)” with gold overlap \= “Clarity \+ Trust.”)_

**Execution Library (SOPs)**

- Step-by-step guides for repeatable processes

- Owned by XP team

- Drives consistency and speed

**Judgment Library (Protocols)**

- Decision rules for high-stakes or ambiguous situations

- Owned jointly by leader \+ XP

- Drives trust and adaptability

**Key Idea (caption):**

Every SOP should have a matching Protocol.
Together they create _clarity \+ trust_ — the foundation of scalable delegation.

---

### **Footer Tagline (centered, minimalist):**

Delegation isn’t about control lost — it’s judgment multiplied.

---

## **🎙️ SPEAKER NOTES (≈2 minutes total)**

“Delegation isn’t binary — it’s a spectrum of maturity.

At the beginning, we delegate **tasks** — ‘Do this exactly this way.’ That’s safe but slow.
As people grow, we move to **process** — SOPs that create consistency. Then to **objectives** — outcomes with autonomy. And finally to **judgment** — intent paired with full trust. That’s when leadership scales.

But language matters. High-performing teams use both **SOPs** and **Protocols.**
SOPs protect quality; they tell us _how_ to execute.
Protocols protect judgment; they tell us _when and why_ to act.
The most effective leaders know when to use each.

And when you combine them, you get a system:
an **Execution Library** of SOPs and a **Judgment Library** of Protocols.

Where they overlap, you get **Clarity \+ Trust** — the core of scalable delegation.

That’s how you stop delegating work and start delegating thinking.
It’s how your systems learn to lead even when you’re not in the room.”

| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🩶 **1\. Thumbs**       | _Emergency Only_    | Delegating from your phone. Use only if there’s no other option. | Minimal — last resort.                                                                                  |

### **Key Idea (centered caption beneath table):**

Delegation maturity isn’t just _what_ you delegate — it’s _how_ you communicate.
Each level moves from reactive to proactive, from speed to scale.

---

### **Footer Tagline:**

_When your XP can delegate to themselves, you’ve reached true leverage._

---

## **🎙️ SPEAKER NOTES (≈2 minutes total)**

“Delegation doesn’t just depend on _what_ you hand off — it depends on _how_ you communicate.

There’s a maturity curve here.

At the most reactive end are **Thumbs** — quick, on-phone delegation. Use it only in emergencies. It’s fast, but fragile — things get lost.

Then come **Fingers**, your standard channel. Delegate via desktop text or email — ideally through a dedicated space just for your XP. Keep chats segmented: _Urgent, Focus, Reminders, Random_. It keeps clarity and retrieval high.

**Voice** is your speed champion. Speaking conveys tone and context in seconds — especially with tools like Wispr Flow or voice-to-text.

**Video**, like Loom, is for “show, don’t tell” situations — perfect for walkthroughs or training your XP asynchronously. It’s how you turn one explanation into a reusable asset.

And finally, **Proactive Delegation** — the ultimate level. Here, your XP assigns tasks to themselves. They block time each day to identify what they can take on. You approve with 👍 or 👎, and track ROI over time.

The shift from Thumbs to Proactive is the shift from _reaction_ to _replication._
When your XP can think and act ahead of you, delegation becomes an engine of leverage.”

Delegation fails not for lack of systems — but because of the stories leaders tell themselves.

## **🎙️ SPEAKER NOTES (≈2 minutes total)**

“Most delegation failures aren’t tactical — they’re emotional.
They come from what I call the _cardinal sins of delegation_: **Pride, Scarcity, and Guilt.**

**Pride** says, ‘I can do it faster or better.’ And that’s often true — in the short term.
But leadership is about leverage, not speed.
Your job is to do only what only you can do — and teach others to close the gap from 70% to 90%.

**Scarcity** says, ‘I don’t have the time, access, or budget to delegate this.’
But leverage shows up where you fund it. Delegation is an investment.
Give people the vault — the files, the context, and the trust — so they can win without waiting on you.

And **Guilt** says, ‘This work is beneath someone.’
But what bores you might build another. Delegation is how people learn.
Frame the why, define the outcome, and treat every handoff as training, not dumping.

If you remember nothing else, remember the mantras:
**Do only what only you can do.**
**Give access, get leverage.**
**Work isn’t beneath; it’s a ladder.**”

# Mastery \- Trust

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

### **How to Build Trust**

Every leader loses time to the same silent thief: low-trust execution. Calls stall. Tasks boomerang. Context gets explained twice. The result? Five to ten hours a week—gone.

In this 30-minute session, you’ll learn how to win those hours back. Drawing on thousands of high-performing executive–Executive Partner partnerships, we’ll show you how to turn support into strategic leverage. Expect practical tools, candid insight, and fast-paced exchanges with peers who move at your speed.

You’ll leave with two proven trust-building systems:

- **The Horse Race**: a simple, visual way to delegate decisions while keeping quality high. It builds judgment and autonomy fast.
- **The** **Weekly Activities Report** (WAR): a crisp, five-minute rhythm that keeps you aligned without micromanagement—trust tracked, not assumed.

Because when trust compounds, so does time.

**Why trust matters**

For decades, educators struggled to crack the problem of improving student performance. Then came a simple experiment: students in grades 1–6 took a fake “aptitude test.” Teachers were told which students scored in the top 20%. In reality, the names were chosen at random.

By the end of the year, those “top 20%” students had outperformed their peers. Nothing had changed except one thing: the teachers trusted them more. They gave them harder work, expected more, and the students rose to the level of trust placed in them.

When you don’t trust your XP, you pay a trust tax. You hold onto work they could do, which costs you 10+ hours a week and keeps them from growing into higher-value work. With trust, the opposite happens: you buy back time, sharpen focus, and create leverage.

High-trust delegation doesn’t just save hours—it frees energy, clears decision bandwidth, and lets you focus only on what moves the business forward.

👉 Then you immediately transition into: “So how do you actually build trust quickly with your XP? Here are two proven methods:

---

# **The Horse Race Method**

## **Purpose**

Effective delegation hinges on your assistant understanding both your explicit instructions and your implicit reasoning. The Horse Race Method accelerates this by having you and your assistant complete the same task in parallel, then debriefing to surface preferences, trade-offs, and decision logic.

## **Method**

### **1\. Set the Track**

**Define clear parameters for a task.**

- **Example:** _“Book a nonstop flight to San Francisco, Tuesday afternoon departure, Thursday evening return. Preference for aisle seat and hotel within walking distance of the convention center.”_

### **2\. Start the Race**

**Both you and your assistant complete the task independently. Record using Zoom/Loom so that you can objectively compare and contrast.**

- **Example:** Both of you book a trip to San Francisco under the same parameters.

### **3\. Compare Results**

**Review both outputs side by side.**

- **Example:** The assistant found a cheaper flight; you found a better hotel rate. The assistant spent 60 minutes; you spent 10 minutes.
- **Discuss trade-offs:** _“The $200 flight savings is great, but the hotel you chose is a 20-minute walk from the venue, which impacts my schedule.” “Your time is valuable, this is how I think about ROI of your time.”_

### **4\. Give Specific Feedback**

**Highlight what worked, what didn’t, and—most importantly—why.**

- _“I prefer the 2 PM flight you found because it allows a morning meeting. But I always pick hotels with 24-hour gyms for jet lag workouts. That’s why I chose mine.”_

### **5\. Refine and Repeat**

**Run several “races” until your assistant consistently anticipates your preferences and decision-making.**

- The goal is deep understanding, not speed.

## **Example Progression**

- **Round 1 — Day Trip (Chicago)**
    - Exec: Early flight, day-use hotel, car service.
    - EA: Later flight, no hotel, taxi.
    - Feedback: _Explain need for early arrivals, refresh space, reliable transport._

- **Round 2 — Multi-Day Trip (London)**
    - Exec: Red-eye, hotel with gym near venue, jet lag gaps.
    - EA: Day flight, cheaper distant hotel, tight schedule.
    - Feedback: _Teach logic of maximizing time, comfort, recovery strategy._

- **Round 3 — Multi-City Trip (Europe)**
    - Exec: Balance business/leisure, flexible tickets, detailed logistics.
    - EA: Similar but misses nuances on mixing work and personal time.
    - Feedback: _Surface deeper decision patterns: when to extend trips, how to stay productive abroad._

## **Why It Works**

- Sharing reasoning demonstrates respect, invites dialogue, and positions the XP as a partner.
- The side-by-side comparison makes invisible decision logic visible and transferable.
- Repetition builds proof that the XP can deliver outcomes indistinguishable from the executive’s own choices—or better.

---

## **How to Use in Practice**

- Pick a recurring, high-context task (travel booking, meeting prep, inbox triage).
- Run 2–3 Horse Races until outputs converge.
- Capture the learned logic in a preferences SOP so it compounds. Here’s a template library.

---

**👉 By the end, your XP doesn’t just “do tasks”—they think with your logic, act with your preferences, and anticipate your moves.**

## **WAR — Weekly Activities Report**

**Purpose**
Executives lose time when there’s no clear rhythm of accountability. Work drifts, priorities misalign, and course corrections arrive too late. The WAR fixes this. It’s both a retro of the week just finished and a plan for the week ahead—giving you visibility on what was achieved, what slipped, and where your input is needed before the new week begins.

---

**How**

1. Every Friday by 3 p.m., your XP sends a one-page WAR.
2. The report has two parts: Retro (the week past) and Plan (the week ahead).
3. Retro covers: _Planned vs. Done, What Moved (with reasons), Learnings._
4. Plan covers: _Top Priorities, Dependencies, and Decisions Needed._
5. You give feedback by Monday 9 a.m.—approve, adjust, or redirect.
6. This rhythm compounds: alignment increases, bottlenecks shrink, trust grows.

---

**What (Worked Example)**

**Retro: Week of Aug 25–29**
– _Investor Meetings_: Planned to secure 3 meetings. Booked with Sequoia (Mon 8/25, 10 a.m.), Index Ventures (Tue 8/26, 2 p.m.), and Tiger Global (Thu 8/28, 4 p.m.). The Sequoia and Index sessions confirmed; Tiger requested to shift to Sep 10\.
– _Board Memo_: Drafted 14-page deck by Wed 8/27, circulated to finance \+ strategy leads on Thu 8/28. Awaiting your review before final polish.
– _Vendor Contract_: Targeted sign-off with Salesforce on Tue 8/26. Delayed after Legal flagged an indemnity clause. I scheduled a follow-up with Salesforce counsel for Mon 9/1 at 11 a.m.
– _Marketing Calendar_: Reviewed draft campaign schedule with BlueSky Creative on Wed 8/27. Two deliverables (Q4 ad concepts) slipped—the team underestimated design hours. Revised deadline set for Tue 9/2.

**Learnings**
– Legal reviews are taking 3+ business days—recommend building in a buffer.
– Creative vendor under-scoped resource needs—need firmer estimates upfront.

---

**Plan: Week of Sept 1–5**
– Finalize Salesforce vendor contract by Wed 9/3.
– Deliver final board memo to directors by Fri 9/5, 12 p.m.
– Launch Q4 hiring search: post roles on LinkedIn (Tue 9/2), start outreach via Greenhouse (Wed 9/3).
– Confirm travel logistics for NYC Investor Day (Oct 14–16): secure hotel block at the Whitby by Thu 9/4.

**Needs Input by Monday 9 a.m.:**
– Of three marketing director candidates (Lee, Patel, Nguyen), which two should we prioritize for first-round interviews?
– Approve NYC investor day travel dates (Oct 14–16) so I can lock hotel block and flights.

# **Slide Deck: _How to Build Trust_**

---

### **Slide 1 — A Lesson from Education**

- Classic experiment: teachers told 20% of students were “gifted” (randomly).
- By year’s end, those students outperformed their peers.
- Why? Teachers trusted them more → expected more → got more.

**Callout:** _Trust changes outcomes._
**Speaker Note:** “The same dynamic applies in executive partnerships.”

---

### **Slide 2: The Horse Race Method**

**Purpose:** Build trust by making invisible decision logic visible.

**Steps:**

1. Set the track → define task.
2. Start the race → both complete task.
3. Compare results → surface trade-offs.
4. Give feedback → teach the _why_.
5. Refine \+ repeat.
   **Visual:** Racetrack with three laps.
   **Speaker Note:** “This compresses years of learning into weeks.”

### **Slide 3 — Horse Race in Practice**

- **Round 1 (Day Trip):** Cost vs time trade-off.
- **Round 2 (International):** Comfort vs efficiency.
  **Round 3 (Multi-City):** Business \+ leisure nuance.
  **Callout:** _“Within 2–3 races, Executive Partners anticipate like the exec.”_
  **Speaker Note:** “It’s not about speed. It’s about shared reasoning.”

### **Slide 4 — Weekly Activities Report (WAR)**

**Purpose:** Replace drift with rhythm.
**Structure:**

- **Retro:** Planned vs Done, Moved, Learnings.
- **Plan:** Priorities, Dependencies, Decisions Needed.
  **Cadence:** Friday 3 p.m. → Monday 9 a.m. review.
  **Cycle:** Retro → Plan → Feedback → Execute.
  **Speaker Note:** “Consistency builds reliability.”

### **Slide 5 — WAR Worked Example**

**Retro:**

- Investor meetings: 2 confirmed, 1 rescheduled.
- Board memo: 14-page draft delivered.
- Vendor contract: delayed—legal.

**Plan:**

- Finalize Salesforce contract.
- Deliver board memo.
- Launch Q4 hiring.
  **Needs Input:** Candidate shortlist, travel approval, gift decision.
  **Speaker Note:** “One page, zero surprises.”

---

### **Slide 6 — Pro Tips \+ Closing**

**Pro Tips:**

- Start small → one live task.
- Codify preferences → capture patterns in SOPs.
- Protect cadence → never skip WAR. Try one horse race per week.
  **Closing Visual:** Executive \+ XP silhouettes linked by gears.
  **Tagline:** _Trust is leverage. Buy back hours. Sharpen focus. Restore momentum._
  **Speaker Note:** “When trust compounds, time comes back, focus sharpens, and momentum returns.”

In a world where leaders are expected to operate at speed, trust is no longer a soft virtue. It is a strategic asset. High-trust partnerships deliver:

- **Time:** 10–15 hours per week returned to the executive.
- **Focus:** Energy reclaimed for the few decisions only the leader can make.
- **Leverage:** XPs operating at the executive’s level, compounding value across various domains.

# **The Trust Playbook**

### This playbook contains two distinct, powerful methods for systematically building trust, turning trust from an abstract idea into a concrete practice. Start with whichever method addresses the area you want to improve first.

- **The Horse Race**: a simple, visual way to delegate decisions while keeping quality high. It builds judgment and autonomy fast.
- **The** **Weekly Activities Report** (WAR): a crisp, five-minute rhythm that keeps you aligned without micromanagement—trust tracked, not assumed.

## **The Horse Race Method**

**Purpose:** To quickly transfer the Executive's implicit decision-making logic to the XP so they can anticipate preferences and make aligned decisions independently.

**Procedure:**

| Step-by-step                                       | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Set the Track (Executive)**                      | Choose a recurring, high-context task (e.g., booking travel, meeting prep). Define the parameters and the desired outcome clearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Set the Track (Executive)Start the Race (Both)** | The Executive and XP complete the task independently. It's highly recommended that both record their screen (using Loom/Zoom) to capture their process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Compare Results (Together)**                     | Review both the final outputs and the screen recordings side-by-side in a debrief meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Give Feedback & Debrief (Executive & XP)**       | Discuss the trade-offs and choices made. **Executive should explain their "why":** "I chose the more expensive flight because it landed at 2 PM, allowing for a pre-dinner meeting. That time is worth more than the $200 savings." **XP should ask clarifying questions:** "I see, so the hierarchy is Time \> Cost for flights, but maybe Cost \> Convenience for hotels?” |
| **Refine & Codify (XP)**                           | After the debrief, the XP should update or create an SOP/preferences document with the newly learned logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Repeat**                                         | Run 2-3 races on different tasks until the XP's outputs converge with the Executive's preferences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**Worked Example:**

**Scenario:** An executive and their XP run a "horse race" to book a business trip.

| 1\. Set the Track (The Task) Executive: _"Let's run a race on this. Please book a nonstop flight to San Francisco for a Tuesday afternoon departure and a Thursday evening return. My preference is an aisle seat and a hotel within walking distance of the convention center."_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2\. Compare Results (The Outputs)** The XP and Executive review the two itineraries side-by-side. XP's Itinerary: Found a flight that was $200 cheaper, but the hotel chosen is a 20-minute walk from the venue. Total time spent: 60 minutes. Executive's Itinerary: The flight is more expensive, but the hotel is directly across the street from the venue and has a 24-hour gym. Total time spent: 10 minutes.                                                                                                                |
| **3\. Debrief & Give Feedback (The 'Why')** Executive: _"The $200 flight savings is great, but the 20-minute walk from the hotel you chose impacts my schedule and energy. My time is valuable, and that's how I think about the ROI of your time as well."_ Executive: _"I also always pick hotels with 24-hour gyms for jet lag workouts. That’s a non-negotiable for me, which is why I chose mine. However, I prefer the 2 PM flight you found because it allows me to finish a morning meeting before heading to the airport."_ |
| **4\. Refine & Codify (The Learning)** XP: _"Okay, I understand. For future travel, the logic is: 1\) Hotel must have a 24-hour gym and be as close to the venue as possible, even if it's more expensive. 2\) Flight departure times should protect morning meetings. I'll add this to your travel preferences SOP."_                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## **Method 2: The Weekly Activities Report (WAR)**

**Purpose:** To create a consistent rhythm of communication and accountability that eliminates surprises, surfaces bottlenecks early, and ensures alignment on weekly priorities.

**Procedure:**

| Step-by-step                              | Actions                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **XP Drafts the WAR**                     | Every Friday by 3:00 PM, the XP will draft a one-page report using the template below and send it to the Executive.                                              |
| **Executive Reviews & Provides Feedback** | The Executive will review the WAR and provide feedback, approvals, and decisions by Monday at 9:00 AM. This closes the loop and sets the direction for the week. |

---

**Worked Example:**

**From:** Daniel Cruz (XP)
**To:** Sarah Lee (Executive)
**Date:** Friday, August 29, 2025, 3:00 PM
**Subject:** WAR for w/e 8/29 & Plan for w/c 9/1

---

Part 1: Retro (Week of Aug 25-29)

- **Planned vs. Done:**
    - **Investor Meetings:** Secured 3 meetings. Sequoia and Index were completed. Tiger Global requested to shift to Sep 10, which I've confirmed.
    - **Board Memo:** 14-page draft was completed and circulated to finance/strategy leads on Thursday. It's now in your inbox awaiting your review.
    - **Salesforce Contract:** This slipped from its target sign-off date of Tuesday. Legal flagged an indemnity clause. I have proactively scheduled a follow-up call with Salesforce counsel for this coming Monday at 11 a.m. to resolve it.
- **Key Learnings:**
    - Legal reviews are consistently taking 3+ business days. I recommend we build this buffer into future contract timelines.
    - Our creative vendor under-scoped their design hours. For the next SOW, I'll ask for firmer estimates upfront.

---

Part 2: Plan (Week of Sept 1-5)

- **Top Priorities:**
    - Finalize Salesforce vendor contract by Wednesday, 9/3.
    - Deliver final board memo to directors by Friday, 9/5, at 12:00 p.m..
    - Launch Q4 hiring search: Post roles on LinkedIn (Tue 9/2) and start outreach (Wed 9/3).
- **Dependencies / Needs Input From You:**
    - To launch the hiring search, please confirm which two of the three marketing director candidates (Lee, Patel, Nguyen) we should prioritize for first-round interviews.
      **Need by Monday 9 AM**.
    - I need your approval on the NYC Investor Day travel dates (Oct 14-16) so I can lock in the hotel block at the preferred rate.
      **Need by Monday 9 AM**.

# Mastery \- Delegating with clarity

# **Athena | Executive Training Session**

**How to delegate with clarity**

## **Slide 1: Intro (2 min)**

Why do misunderstandings seem to happen so often? Let’s use 2 client stories to see why.

**Client 1:** We’ll start with Rebecca. Rebecca is the founder of a wellness startup. She asked her XP, Luis, “Can you post this announcement to LinkedIn?”

The announcement was a paragraph about a new product launch, already drafted by Rebecca. Luis cleaned up the formatting, made sure the links worked, and posted it right away.

After a few days, Rebecca checked the post and frowned. She fired off an email to Luis. “This isn’t getting much traction,” she said. “I thought we’d get more engagement. Did you tag the investors? Find a teaser image? What about timing it for peak visibility?”

Rebecca revised the post on her own before giving Luis a chance to respond.

Luis’ response was apologetic. He thanked Rebecca for the feedback and said he will do his best to avoid these mistakes in the future.

Privately, he wondered where he went wrong. He executed the task perfectly: post a well-worded post to LinkedIn.

**What went wrong?** Rebecca, who asked her XP to finalize a LinkedIn post was frustrated because what she really wanted was to achieve a goal: drive excitement, visibility, and engagement for the launch.

What she actually did was delegate a task: Post this to LinkedIn.

She wanted a goal but delegated a task.

**Client 2:** Our second story comes from Bryan, co-founder of a B2B SaaS company. He was a month away from a major product launch when he turned to his XP, Jess, and said, “Can you make sure the launch is a success?”

Jess nodded, eager to help, and got to work.

She threw herself into the project. She created a checklist, booked a team lunch for launch day, double-checked calendar invites for the engineering sprint review, updated the internal wiki with past launch notes, and emailed the office manager to restock snacks for the launch watch party. She also skimmed the product roadmap and made a few notes about bugs, in case this was helpful for the team.

When Bryan circled back three days before the launch, he was frustrated beyond belief.

“Why are we behind on customer outreach? This is the most important part\!”

Jess was confused—“I thought this was about logistics,” she said.

**What went wrong?** The XP did a lot of work: Checklists, calendar invites, reviews, sprints.

What she didn’t do—because Bryan never mentioned it—was draft or send the customer launch email, or coordinate with marketing on the press release.

Bryan had assumed she’d know what mattered most, but Jess was never trained to generate a launch comms plan from scratch.

She had good intentions, skills, and motivation, but no framework for prioritizing what would actually make the launch “a success.”

Bryan wanted a task but delegated a goal.

**How to solve?** In both cases, the problems would have been avoided with 5 simple words: “Repeat it back to me.”

## **Slide II. Framework: Four Pillars of Delegating With Clarity (8 min)**

Pillar 1: What (“Do X”)
Pillar 2: What For (“To achieve Y”)
Pillar 3: Why (“We need this because of Z”)
Pillar 4: Repeat It Back (“Repeat back what you’ve heard from me”)

## **Slide III. 4 Pillar Playbook (7 min)**

## **Responsibilities**

- **You**: Clearly communicate using the 4-Pillar framework.
- **EA**: Listen, repeat back, execute.

## **Procedure**

### **1\. What (Do X)**

- **Steps**:
    - State the task or objective explicitly (e.g., "Schedule a meeting with the marketing team").
    - Provide relevant details, deadlines, tools, and requirements (e.g., "Use Google Calendar and set it for next week on a free morning").
- **Example**: "Prepare a presentation for the Q3 sales review by Friday."

### **2\. What For (To Achieve Y)**

- **Steps**:
    - Describe the purpose of the task and what success looks like (e.g., "To ensure the team is aligned on sales targets").
    - Link the task to a broader objective, if applicable.
- **Example**: "To achieve Y: To provide the leadership team with clear insights into Q3 performance."

### **3\. Why (Because of Z)**

- **Steps**:
    - Explain why the task is necessary, including any relevant background or priorities (e.g., "We need this because the board requested a detailed review").
    - Highlight how urgent/important or non-urgent / non-important it is
- **Example**: "Because of Z: We need this because the board is evaluating our sales strategy for next quarter."

### **4\. Repeat It Back (Tell Me What You Heard)**

- **Steps**:
    - Ask the EA to restate the task, goal, and reasoning in their own words (e.g., "Can you repeat back what I’ve asked you to do?").
    - Listen actively and clarify any discrepancies or misunderstandings.
    - Confirm agreement before proceeding (e.g., "That’s correct, please go ahead").
- **Example**: "Tell me what you heard."

## **Example: Schedule a client dinner**

**Task**: Schedule a client dinner.

- **What**: "Book a dinner reservation for 6 people at an Italian restaurant for next Thursday at 7 PM."
- **What For**: "To build stronger relationships with the client for our upcoming project."
- **Why**: "Because the client requested a face-to-face meeting to discuss contract terms."
- **Repeat**: "Please repeat back what I’ve asked you to do, why it’s important, and the goal."

**EA Response**: "I’ll book a dinner for 6 at an Italian restaurant for Thursday at 7 PM to strengthen our client relationship because they want to discuss contract terms. Is that correct?"
**Delegator Confirmation**: "Yes, that’s correct. Please proceed."

Time unlocked: **1 hour/week for each task delegated clearly saved by avoiding confusion and mistakes**

## **Slide IV. Live Exercise (7 min)**

- **Prompt:** Each participant picks one live task they want to delegate to XP
- **Exercise:** (1) In pairs with their Executive Partner (or peer if solo), they run through the 4-Pillar SOP (What, What For, Why, Repeat It Back).
- **Share back:** 2–3 volunteers present their delegation framing.

## **V. Commitment Capture (3 min)**

- **Ask:** “Send email to EA asking them to hold you accountable for using the 4-Pillar framework starting now”
- **Action:** Each participant writes down email to EA asking them to start using the 4-Pillar framework and hold each other accountable for using it in all delegations
- **Follow-up:** Executive Partner tracks whether 4-Pillars framework has been used in all delegations in the following 2 weeks

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

**Delegating With Clarity**

### **The Cost of Misunderstanding**

Even the sharpest executives lose hours each week to a surprisingly basic failure: unclear delegation.

Consider two recent client stories.

**Rebecca, founder of a wellness startup**, asked her EA, Luis, “Can you post this announcement to LinkedIn?”
Luis did exactly that—cleaned the formatting, checked the links, posted promptly. Task executed flawlessly.

But Rebecca was frustrated days later. Engagement was low. No investors tagged, no teaser image, no peak-time posting. In her mind, Luis had missed the point. She wanted visibility and excitement. What she actually delegated was: _Post this to LinkedIn._

She wanted a **goal** but delegated a **task**.

---

**Bryan, co-founder of a SaaS company**, was weeks away from a product launch. He told his EA, Jess: “Make sure the launch is a success.”

Jess threw herself into logistics—calendars, checklists, team lunch, bug tracking, even office snacks. But she missed the core: customer outreach and press coordination. Bryan never mentioned it.

He wanted a **task** but delegated a **goal**.

---

Both executives were left frustrated. Both Executive Partners felt they had done good work. Neither partnership had a clear definition of “what good looks like.”

The fix? Five simple words: **“Repeat it back to me.”**

---

## **The Four Pillars of Clarity**

Delegation breaks down not because of bad intentions, but because of gaps in framing. The cure is a disciplined, four-part framework:

1. **What (Do X)**
   _State the task clearly._
   Example: “Book a dinner reservation for six people at an Italian restaurant next Thursday at 7 p.m.”

2. **What For (To Achieve Y)**
   _Describe the goal or outcome._
   Example: “To build stronger relationships with the client for our upcoming project.”

3. **Why (Because of Z)**
   _Give context and urgency._
   Example: “Because the client requested a face-to-face meeting to discuss contract terms.”

4. **Repeat It Back**
   _Ask your Executive Partner to restate what they heard._
   Example: “I’ll book a dinner for six at an Italian restaurant next Thursday at 7 p.m. to strengthen our client relationship because they want to discuss contract terms. Is that correct?”

These four steps transform delegation from guesswork into alignment.

---

### **Sidebar: The Gap Analysis**

- **Task without Goal** → Work done, outcome missed.
- **Goal without Task** → Energy expended, priorities misplaced.
- **Task \+ Goal \+ Why \+ Repeat** → Alignment secured, trust compounded.

---

## **Playbook: 4 Pillars**

**Responsibilities**

- **Executive:** Communicate using the Four Pillars.
- **Executive Partner:** Listen, repeat back, execute.

**Procedure**

1. **What (Do X)**
    - Explicit task with details, deadlines, tools.
    - _Example:_ “Prepare a presentation for the Q3 sales review by Friday.”

2. **What For (To Achieve Y)**
    - Define success.
    - _Example:_ “To ensure the team is aligned on sales targets.”

3. **Why (Because of Z)**
    - Give background, urgency, or strategic purpose.
    - _Example:_ “Because the board is evaluating our sales strategy for next quarter.”

4. **Repeat It Back**
    - EA restates the task, goal, and reasoning.
    - Executive confirms alignment before execution.

**Worked Example**
Task: Schedule a client dinner.

- What: “Book a dinner for six people at an Italian restaurant next Thursday at 7 p.m.”
- What For: “To strengthen our client relationship before contract negotiations.”
- Why: “Because the client requested a face-to-face meeting.”
- Repeat: “Book dinner for six next Thursday at 7 p.m., Italian restaurant, to strengthen ties because they want to discuss contract terms. Correct?”
- Confirmation: “Yes. Proceed.”

**Impact:** One clear cycle saves \~1 hour per task by eliminating rework and confusion. Multiply by dozens of tasks each week, and the ROI is extraordinary.

---

## **The Live Exercise**

Theory only sticks when practiced. In Athena sessions, executives run a live test:

1. Pick a task you want to delegate now.
2. Run it through the Four Pillars with your EA (or peer).
3. Share back with the group.

The shift is immediate. Executives realize how often they skip context. Executive Partners appreciate how clarity makes them more effective. Misalignment evaporates.

---

## **Commitment Capture**

The final step: accountability.

- **Action:** Each executive emails their EA:
  _“Hold me accountable for using the Four Pillar framework in every delegation.”_
- **Follow-up:** For two weeks, Executive Partners track whether delegations meet the Four Pillars.

The result is not just clarity, but cultural reinforcement. Delegation quality rises. Trust compounds. Both sides level up.

---

## **Why This Matters**

The difference between a mediocre and a world-class partnership is rarely effort. It is clarity.

- **With clarity:** Tasks align to goals, Executive Partners anticipate, and trust deepens.
- **Without clarity:** Effort misfires, frustration grows, and trust erodes.

Executives who master the Four Pillars don’t just avoid mistakes—they multiply leverage.

---

## **Final Word**

Delegation is not about giving orders. It’s about **defining what good looks like**. The Four Pillars make it teachable, repeatable, and scalable.

The payoff is not just hours back, but alignment, trust, and momentum.

As one Athena client put it:

_“Once we started using the Four Pillars, I never had to redo work. I got back hours every week, and my EA started running two steps ahead.”_

# **Delegating with Clarity Playbook**

This playbook is designed for an Executive to review and implement with their Executive Partner (XP) after attending the live Mastery Session.

---

## **The Problem: The High Cost of Misunderstanding**

Even the best partnerships lose hours each week to unclear delegation. This happens when one person delegates a task (e.g., "Post this to LinkedIn") but expects a goal to be met _(e.g., "Drive high engagement for our launch")._ Or, when they delegate a goal _("Make the launch a success")_ but have specific tasks in mind that are never stated. This leads to wasted effort, frustration, and erodes trust.

---

## **The Solution: The Four Pillars of Clarity**

To eliminate these gaps, we use a simple but powerful four-part framework for every delegation. This framework ensures that both the "what" and the "why" are always clear.

- **Pillar 1: What (Do X)**: State the task explicitly, including details, deadlines, and tools.
- **Pillar 2: What For (To Achieve Y)**: Describe the desired outcome and what success looks like.
- **Pillar 3: Why (Because of Z)**: Explain the context, priority, and strategic importance.
- **Pillar 4: Repeat It Back**: Confirm understanding by restating the request.

| :-------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
|       **Task without Goal**       | Work is done, but the outcome is missed.          |
|       **Goal without Task**       | Energy is expended, but priorities are misplaced. |
| **Task \+ Goal \+ Why \+ Repeat** | Alignment is secured, and trust is compounded.    |

| **Executive Partner** | **\*(Proactively asking using the Four Pillars to clarify\*\***): "Happy to. To make sure I get it right: (For the 'What') How many people total? Is there a preferred day, time, or location? (For the 'What For') What's the main goal of this dinner? Is it a casual relationship-builder or are you planning to close the deal? (For the 'Why') Just so I can prioritize, how urgent is it to get this on the calendar?"\* | **\*Confirmation & Follow-up:** "Got it. I'll book a dinner for 6 at an Italian restaurant for next Thursday at 7 PM. The goal is to strengthen the client relationship before you discuss contract terms. Is that correct?" **(Optional question showing initiative):** "Should I prioritize restaurants with a private room in case the conversation gets detailed?"\* |

## **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**

This is how we put the Four Pillars into practice for every delegation.

|         Role          | Responsibilities                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     **Executive**     | Clearly communicate using the Four Pillar framework for every delegation.                                                                 |
| **Executive Partner** | Actively listen for all four pillars. Proactively **"repeat back"** to confirm understanding, even if not prompted. Execute with clarity. |

| Step-by-step                   | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Executive Communicates**     | **What:** _"Prepare a presentation for the Q3 sales review by Friday."_ **What For:** _"To provide the leadership team with clear insights into our Q3 performance."_ **Why:** _"Because the board is evaluating our sales strategy for next quarter, so this data is critical."_                     |
| **Executive Partner Confirms** | **Repeat It Back:** The assistant asks to clarify or states their understanding. _"Okay, so I will prepare the Q3 sales review presentation, due Friday. The goal is to give leadership clear performance insights because the board needs it to evaluate next quarter's strategy. Is that correct?"_ |
| **Executive Validates**        | **Confirmation:** The executive listens and confirms alignment before work begins. "Yes, that's correct. Please proceed."                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Note for the XP: Why "Repeating It Back" is a Power Move**:

Proactively repeating back the What, What For, and Why is more than just a confirmation step. It demonstrates that you are a strategic partner who thinks about outcomes, not just tasks. This habit builds immense trust and positions you as an indispensable part of the team.

## **Implementation and Accountability**

To make this our new standard:

1. **Action:** The Executive will send an email to their XP to establish this as a shared goal.
    - **Template:** _"Hi \[XP Name\], I want to improve our delegation process to ensure we're always aligned. Moving forward, I will use the 'What, What For, Why' framework. Please hold me accountable for this. To close the loop, I'd like you to always 'Repeat it Back' to me to confirm you have everything you need. This will help us both move faster and avoid confusion."_
2. **Follow-up:** For the next two weeks, the Executive Partner will track whether the Four Pillars were used in delegations. This builds a shared habit.

The result is a partnership where clarity eliminates rework, builds trust, and allows the Executive Partner to anticipate needs and operate more strategically.

# Mastery \- Measuring and Improving Delegation

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

**How to measure and improve delegation**

## **Slide I. Hook (2 min)**

We can have all the best intentions and motivation in the world, but they will not be enough to achieve a goal.

Many people set amazing goals but fail to accomplish them. One of the most obvious is probably when people set a new year’s resolution to go to the gym more or eat a more healthy diet. Studies show that only 8% of new year’s resolutions actually continue past the first month following the new year. Just 6% make it through the entire year.

Why?

As the old saying goes, “what gets measured, gets managed.”

The same goes for delegation – measuring and improving are the keys to success.

## **Slide II. 3 Tests (8 min)**

How should we measure delegation?

We use the 3 tests method:

We measure the intent test (can the EA think like you?), the autonomy test (does the EA act without you?) and feedback loop test (do you learn and fix drift fast?).

# **III. The 3 tests SOP (8 mins)**

Instructions:

1. **Set Aside 45 Minutes**: Meet with your EA and direct team.
2. **Run the Tests**: Ask the provided questions, letting the EA answer first.
3. **Score and Discuss**: Rate each test (1-5), identify gaps, and plan improvements.
4. **Revisit Quarterly**: Repeat every 90 days to track progress.

**The 3 Tests**

**1\. Intent Test: Do they think like you?**

**Purpose**: Ensure your EA aligns with your values and decision-making logic.

**Questions**:

- What values guide my decisions?
- What tradeoffs do I consistently make?
- When did you last act based on what I would have done?
  **Scoring**:
- 1: Needs constant clarification, asks before every step.
- 3: Understands intent but hesitates in ambiguous situations.
- 5: Anticipates your judgment, acts with your logic and values.
  **High Score Unlock**: They act proactively, and you trust their decisions.

**2\. Autonomy Test: Do they act without you?**

**Purpose**: Assess if your EA owns decisions independently.
**Questions**:

- What decisions do you make without me?
- What do you still escalate that we could systematize?
- What’s a recent decision you made solo?
  **Scoring**:
- 1: Everything waits for your approval.
- 3: Handles routine tasks but pauses on ambiguity.
- 5: Owns entire domains, informing you without involving you.
  **High Score Unlock**: You’re no longer the bottleneck.

**3\. Feedback Loop Test: Do you fix drift fast?**

**Purpose**: Ensure misalignments are caught and corrected quickly.
**Questions**:

- What’s the last misaligned decision, and how did we catch it?
- Do you feel safe flagging unclear intent?
- How do we review and improve decisions?
  **Scoring**:
- 1: Drift lingers, fixes are slow or avoided.
- 3: Misalignments caught but corrections are inconsistent.
- 5: Drift is caught early, fixes are open and frictionless.
  **High Score Unlock**: Feedback sharpens the system, preventing compounded errors.

**Scorecard**

- **Calculate**: Average the scores from the three tests (Intent, Autonomy, Feedback).
- **Interpret**:
    - **5.0**: Judgment scaled; you’re free to lead.
    - **4.0–4.9**: Outcomes move; you’re nearly hands-off.
    - **3.0–3.9**: Work moves, but judgment still flows through you.
    - **\<3.0**: You’ve only multiplied hands, not delegated.
- **Reflect**: Identify one repeatable behavior to boost the average score by 1 point in 30 days.

**LIVE EXERCISE: Steps to Improve Delegation**

1. **Write a Decision Guide**:
    - List 5 values or principles guiding your decisions.
    - Note 3 frequent tradeoffs (e.g., speed vs. quality).
    - Document 3 past decisions showcasing your thinking.
2. **Delegate One Decision Type**:
    - Choose one area (e.g., calendar priorities, client escalations).
    - Define success, set guardrails, and share past decision patterns.
3. **Weekly Intent Check**:
    - Set a recurring calendar invite Every Friday, review:
        - What decisions were made?
        - Which matched your intent?
        - Where was there drift, and why?
    - Adjust and refine as a habit.

**The 90-Day Challenge**

- Re-run the tests quarterly.
- Track score changes to measure leverage.
- Goal: Scale judgment, not just save time.

**Why It Works**: This framework quickly finds out the current status of delegation on your team. It also provides a scorecard unique to each component of delegation (intent, autonomy, feedback loop).

# Mastery \- Safe Space for Learning From Mistakes

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

**How to create a safe space to learn**

_(30 minutes | Executive \+ Executive Partner)_

---

## **I. Hook (2 min) CHANGE TO FOCUS ON FUTURE**

Let’s start with two clients who stumbled upon a winning formula for today’s topic, totally unintentionally.

1\. Jen and Marcus (not real names) were a married couple who co-founded a boutique architecture firm. Jen was the design visionary. Marcus was the operations lead. Together, they hired an EA named Emily (not real name) to support them both.

At first, Emily found it... confusing.

2\. Jen would say things like, “No pressure if you don’t have time,” and “You’re doing great, even if this week’s been rough.” She’d leave handwritten notes with smiley faces. When Emily forgot to confirm an important client walkthrough, Jen brushed it off: “Don’t worry—we’ve all been there.”

When Emily sent a client email with some awkward phrasing, Jen didn’t edit it or mention the mistake. Instead, she **re-sent the email herself**, worded more carefully, and CC’d Emily—then privately texted her, “Yours was great\! Just wanted to offer an alternate tone in case it’s ever helpful 💛”

3\. Marcus, meanwhile, was all about standards. He’d reply to late updates with timestamps: “This was due at 4:00. You sent it at 4:36.” He kept a whiteboard checklist titled “No Slip-Ups.”

Every Monday, Marcus sent Emily a spreadsheet labeled **“Week in Review – Timestamp Log.”** It included a line-by-line list of her deliverables with exact submission times compared to expected deadlines. Even if something was delivered at 9:58 when the deadline was 10:00, he’d mark it “✅ On time.” But at 10:01? “⚠️ Missed.”

Emily was dealing with these two opposites. Individually neither approach worked. With Jen, Emily felt safe but unchallenged. With Marcus, she felt scrutinized and anxious.

But together \-- something unexpected happened. Emily actually flourished. Marcus’ deadlines and discipline set the bar for her, and Jen’s safety allowed her to make mistakes that inevitably happened as Emily navigated through Marcus’ exacting demands.

Emily started owning more client coordination, even proactively tightening timelines before Marcus had to ask. She began to feel OK admitting to mistakes because she knew she could rely on Jen to help her through them.

For her one-year anniversary, Jen sent her flowers. Marcus sent her a bullet-pointed performance summary with the subject line: “Emily: Steady Climb.”

    Let’s understand why Marcus and Jen stumbled on a winning combination

- In research on teams, researchers have found that learning and improvement can be predicted from a combination of two factors:
- The sense of low threat \== the sense that the EA can strive for great work while using mistakes as a platform for learning and improvement
- The sense of high challenge \== the sense that the EA is held to high expectations and standards for performance
- We have the following balance between these two factors: Low threat \+ high challenge

---

## **II. Framework: Low Threat \+ High Challenge \= Stellar Performance (8 min)**

We want a balance of low threat and high challenge for our EA:

![][image1]
**Low Threat \+ Low Challenge → Apathy Zone**

1. EA is neither supported nor expected to contribute meaningfully. 2. Low energy, low ownership

**High Threat \+ High Challenge → Burnout**

1. EA is not supported and has high expectations put on them 2. Might feel positive and energizing at first, but unsustainable as it creates burnout over time

**High Threat \+ Low Challenge → Anxiety Zone**

- EA is pushed to perform but fears judgment or punishment.
- Results in silence, stress, and defensive behavior—EA plays it safe.

**Low Threat \+ High Challenge → High-Performance Zone**

- EA is supported and is expected to deliver.
- Encourages thoughtful expansion into new tasks, feedback, and ownership.

---

# **III. Focus on the Future: Achieving the Winning Balance of Low Threat \+ High Challenge SOP (8 mins)**

1. **Focus on a task you need to give feedback on**:
    - Review the recent tasks you delegated and identify one that your EA can use your feedback on
2. **Give feedback with a focus on the future**:
    - Identify the areas in the EA’s performance that require improvement
    - Begin your feedback with: “In the future, we’ll want not to do X and instead do Y” , replacing X with the EA’s mistakes and replacing Y with the right course of action
3. **Ensure understanding:** Say “repeat it back to me” or “summarize to me what you understood”

###

---

## **IV. Live Exercise (7 min)**

- **Prompt:** Each participant picks a task (i.e. email inbox management, calendar management, etc.) and discusses an area for improvement with their EA. Each participant practices giving feedback to the EA that balances low threat and high challenge by focusing on the future. EA evaluates whether the participants was able to achieve this balance.
- **Exercise:** In pairs with their Executive Partner role-playing peer if solo.
- **Share back:** 2–3 volunteers present their delegation framing.

---

## **V. Commitment Capture (3 min)**

- **Ask:** “Ask EA begin setting up the SOP described above”
- **Action:** Each participant tells the EA or writes email to EA asking them to begin the SOP
- **Follow-up:** Executive Partner tracks the feedback you give over time, and provides their own assessment of the balance between safety and accountability and shows to you. Periodically, you and the EA review whether adjustments should be made.

# Mastery \- Balancing Control and Autonomy

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

**How to balance control and autonomy**

## **I. Hook (2 min)**

One of our clients launched a micro-investing app and hired a new EA to manage schedules and investor relations. Initially, our client was all-in command-and-control style—dictating email wording and slide deck formats, micromanaging everything. This stifled his XP, leading to uninspired work and small errors like a misfiled report.

After attending a coaching session with us, the client shifted to trust-and-teach, giving the XP autonomy to meet clear goals while offering weekly “teach-ins” for feedback.The arrangement saved our client a ton of time because the XP was fully capable of helping the client with emails and other invitations to connect.

**Why It Worked**: Our client’s shift between trust-and-teach (empowering the EA creativity) and command-and-control (oversight for critical tasks) drove performance and averted mistakes.

## **II. Framework: Shifting Gears between Trust & Teach vs. Command & Control (8 min)**

We have to balance control and autonomy when we delegate.

We have two gears:

(1) Trust & Teach – generally characterized by autonomy that we give our EA to do his/her work
(2) Command & Control – generally characterized by us taking over

By default, we should be in Gear \#1 – trust & teach.

You delegate tasks to your EA and trust him/her to accomplish these tasks. You provide periodic feedback and assess progress, but otherwise don’t step in and take control. In the long-run, this is the best way to reclaim your time and make delegation work for you.

However, if the EA is struggling on a time-sensitive or important task, then you need to switch gears to command & control, and take over.

The best way to do this is to tell your EA to ask you take back control when the EA feels that they’re struggling and need your help.

That way, you don’t have to spend the time and attention to monitor everything – the EA will have a better understanding from the ground for when you should step in.

## **III. Playbook: Trust & Teach SOP for Calendar and Inbox Management (7 min) **

### **Step 1: Setup (One-Time)**

1. **Recap the Framework with EA**:
    - **Gear 1 (Trust & Teach)**: EA handles tasks independently; you provide feedback via weekly check-ins.
    - **Gear 2 (Command & Control)**: You take over temporarily; triggered by EA's signal.
2. **Establish Signaling Mechanism**: Agree on how the EA signals for Gear 2 (e.g., Slack message: "Switching to Gear 2 on \[task\] – need your input"; or email flag: "Urgent: Gear 2 Request").

### **Step 2: Gear 1: Trust & Teach – Default Mode**

1. **Delegate Tasks**: Assign calendar and inbox responsibilities via a shared task list or email (e.g., "Manage my inbox starting today: triage, draft responses for approval on non-routine items, schedule routine meetings").
2. **Empower Autonomy**: Allow the EA to make decisions within guidelines (e.g., reschedule low-priority meetings, respond to standard inquiries).
3. **Provide Feedback**: Hold brief weekly reviews (15-30 minutes) to discuss progress, successes, and areas for improvement.

### **Step 3: Switching Gears (Gear 2: Command & Control – Exception Mode)**

1. **Trigger**: EA self-assesses for struggles, such as:
    - Time-sensitive tasks (e.g., urgent meeting rescheduling with a key client).
    - High-importance items (e.g., sensitive email involving contracts or disputes).
    - Uncertainty (e.g., conflicting priorities or unclear instructions).
2. **EA Signals Switch**: EA notifies you immediately via agreed mechanism (e.g., "need your direction Q3 earnings call scheduling – potential conflict with board meeting").
3. **You Take Over**:
    - Assume control (e.g., resolve the issue directly).
    - Limit intervention to the specific task; avoid blanket takeover.
4. **Resolve and Debrief**:
    - Debrief with EA (e.g., "Here's why I prioritized X – let's align on this for next time").
    - Switch back to Gear 1 once resolved.

---

## **IV. Live Exercise (7 min)**

- **Prompt:** Each participant starts the Trust & Teach and Command & Control SOP, preferably with their EA
- **Exercise:** (1) In pairs with their Executive Partner (or peer if solo), they run through the SOP
- **Share back:** 2–3 volunteers present their delegation framing.

---

## **V. Commitment Capture (3 min)**

- **Ask:** “Ask EA to prepare all necessary feedback meetings, logs, and gear-shift triggers so that you can implement the SOP immediately.”
- **Action:** Each participant tells the EA or writes email to EA asking them to begin / continue the SOP
- **Follow-up:** Executive Partner tracks when changes have been implemented and their effects. Executive Partner schedules the next review of this SOP in the following quarter.

# Mastery \- Stop Fixing People. Fix the System

# **Athena | Executive Playbook**

**How to build a delegation system**

## **I. Hook (2 min)**

In early 2005, Linda Brown joined Zappos as a warehouse associate. She was in her early 20s, had just moved out of her apartment in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, and badly needed extra cash for a new rental deposit. A steady paycheck—and the fact that Zappos covered the cost of her four-week training program—felt like a lifeline.

Two weeks in, her manager gathered the trainees in a conference room. After thanking them for their progress, he made an announcement Linda would never forget:

“You’re doing great. But today we have an offer: we’ll pay you $2,000 to quit. No questions asked.”

The room went silent. Linda looked around. Had she heard that right? $2,000 just to walk away? It was an almost irresistible temptation.

In the end, Linda stayed. So did 97% of her classmates.

Why would Zappos pay people to leave?

Because the company understood a simple truth: To get people to be committed to working there, fix the system. The $2,000 offer was about creating a moment of decision. Those who stayed became more deeply invested in Zappos, not because of prior loyalty, but because of management created a system of commitment.

The results spoke for themselves. In an industry plagued by high turnover, Zappos boasted some of the best retention rates in the business.

**Case for change**: Trying to change your EA is a very difficult way of getting things done. Instead, look first to fix the system that the EA is working under. When you see a gap in their work, ask them: What in the work environment: SOPs, deadlines, feedback loop, tech tools, amount of interruptions, access to resources, etc., is preventing you from doing your best?

Here are 3 proven things that you can do to create an optimal system:

---

## **II. Framework: Performance \= Capabilities × System (8 min)**

To improve the EA’s performance and help him or her excel, you have two levers:

1. Their capabilities – long-term change through training and continuous feedback
2. The System they work in – quick and potentially impactful change to boost performance without having to wait

Focus first on Lever \#2 – it is quicker, easier to shift, and can potentially have a tremendous impact.

### **1\. Build Commitment Moments, Not Compliance Systems**

**Why it works:**
Behavioral economics research (e.g., _Cialdini, 2009; Ariely, 2010_) shows that when people make an active choice, their sense of ownership increases dramatically. Zappos’ $2,000 quit offer was a textbook “commitment device”—it transformed a passive job into an intentional choice.

**How to apply it:**
Create small but visible moments where employees opt in.

- Example: Ask your XP or team to re-commit weekly to their top three priorities, or design a weekly or monthly reporintg to include a “Why I’m here” reflection. Share it publicly, even if just within the team or their family or friends, if possible
- For XPs: At the start of each week/month/quarter, invite them to restate what success looks like in their role and what support they need from you to achieve it.

### **2\. Redesign Feedback Loops for Psychological Safety**

**Why it works:**
Studies from _Google’s Project Aristotle_ and _Amy Edmondson’s_ research on psychological safety show that teams with open, rapid feedback loops outperform those without them. In many executive-assistant systems, gaps in communication are mistaken for competence issues.

**How to apply it:**
Fix the _feedback architecture_:

- Replace ad-hoc corrections with a **weekly calibration ritual** (10-minute “What’s working / What’s not” sync).
- Use structured prompts such as: “One thing I need more clarity on is…” or “One thing that would make me faster next week is…”.
- Research shows these micro-loops reduce rework, boost morale, and improve retention.

### **3\. Audit and Simplify the Work Environment**

**Why it works:**
The _Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) model_ (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007\) proves that burnout and underperformance usually stem not from low effort, but from a mismatch between resources and demands. When leaders fix friction points—unclear SOPs, tool overload, constant interruptions—performance rises naturally.

**How to apply it:**

Run a **“friction audit”** every week with your XP:

- Ask: “What’s one recurring obstacle that slows you down or frustrates you?”
- Categorize by type: process, tool, clarity, or bandwidth.
- Eliminate one per week. Even minor changes (simplifying file access, standardizing calendar rules) yield disproportionate gains.

### **Takeaway**

When you think something’s “a people problem,” assume it’s a system problem until proven otherwise.
Fix the system—through intentional commitment, structured feedback, and friction reduction—and you’ll see both trust and results accelerate.

## **V. Commitment Capture (3 min)**

- **Ask:** “Ask EA to book 30 mins on your calendar to complete the System Audit and come up with actionable improvements”
- **Action:** Each participant writes down email to EA asking them to begin / continue the System Audit SOP
- **Follow-up:** Assistant tracks when changes have been implemented and their effects. Assistant schedules the next System Audit in the following quarter.

## **Weekly Executive–EA System Alignment Template**

**Purpose:**
To align priorities, surface friction, and ensure both partners are working from clarity and commitment—not assumption.

---

### **1\. Weekly Commitment & “Why I’m Here” Reflection**

_(Takes 3 minutes each, done independently before the meeting)_

**Executive:**

- This week, I’m committed to: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Why this matters (my “why”): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- What success looks like by Friday: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- What I need from my EA to achieve this: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Executive Partner (XP):**

- This week, I’m committed to: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- Why this matters (my “why”): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- What success looks like by Friday: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- What I need from my executive to achieve this: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

_(Note: As trust builds, shift to monthly and quarterly commitments.)_

---

### **2\. 10-Minute Calibration Ritual**

_(Do this together—fast, direct, and without defensiveness)_

**Step 1: What’s Working / What’s Not**

- What’s working well right now?
- What’s not working or starting to slip?

**Step 2: Two Quick Prompts**

- One thing I need more clarity on is: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- One thing that would make me faster next week is: \_\_\_\_\_\_

_(Tip: Keep responses short—bullet-style, not paragraphs. Capture follow-ups separately.)_

---

### **3\. Weekly Friction Audit**

_(Both complete separately, then compare notes—takes 2 minutes)_

**Prompt:**
What’s one recurring obstacle that slows you down or frustrates you?

| Category  | Description of Friction                         | Date Logged | Owner | Status      |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Process   | e.g., unclear handoffs between inbox & calendar | 10/07       | XP    | Eliminated  |
| Tool      | e.g., meeting notes scattered across platforms  | 10/07       | Exec  | In Progress |
| Clarity   | e.g., unsure of decision authority on expenses  | 10/07       | XP    | Open        |
| Bandwidth | e.g., too many same-day changes to schedule     | 10/07       | Exec  | Eliminated  |

_(Track on a shared sheet. Each week, eliminate one source of friction. As systems stabilize, move to monthly → quarterly audits.)_

---

### **4\. Optional Wrap-Up (2 minutes)**

- One thing I appreciated this week: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
- One small experiment we’ll try next week: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

### **Summary Flow**

| Step                                       | Owner    | Duration          |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| Individual reflections (Commitment \+ Why) | Both     | 5 min             |
| 10-min sync (Calibrate \+ Clarity prompts) | Together | 10 min            |
| Friction audit \+ update sheet             | Both     | 5 min             |
| **Total Weekly Time**                      |          | **15–20 minutes** |

# Playbook Essentials Pack

She was on flight UA 458 last Saturday and purchased the in-flight Wi-Fi, but it wasn't operational.

Yes, I can confirm there was a network outage reported. I've gone ahead and processed a full refund of $29.99 back to the card on file._ XP (Leo): _That's great, thank you. Could you please provide a confirmation number for the refund?_ United Agent (Jake): _Of course. The confirmation is UK5-820B._ XP (Leo): _Got it. UK5-820B. Thank you for your help, Jake._ |

### Worked Sample

**Sourcing a Book**

1.  The Initial Request (Client sends via text):
    _(Client sends a picture of the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman)_

| _Find this book for me. Find a used version at the lowest possible price that can get here within the next 48 hours._ |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

2. The XP's Follow-up (Sent 20 minutes later):

| _Hi\! Here are the best options I found for 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' that meet your criteria: Option A: ThriftBooks Price: $5.19 Condition: Very Good Delivery: Arrives by Thursday afternoon (within 48 hours). Option B: Amazon Marketplace Price: $7.80 Condition: Very Good Delivery: Arrives by tomorrow afternoon (fastest). Recommendation: I recommend Option A (ThriftBooks). Why: It perfectly balances your two key requests. It is the lowest price by over 30% and is guaranteed to arrive within your 48-hour deadline. While Option B is one day faster, the $2.61 savings with Option A seems more aligned with your primary goal of finding the best possible deal. Please give this message a 'thumbs up' (👍) to approve the purchase of Option A. Let me know if you'd prefer Option B._ |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

3. The Client's Approval:

(Client reacts to the message with a 👍 emoji)

4. The Final Confirmation (XP sends a few minutes later):

| ✅ Purchase Made: 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman (Used, Very Good) Vendor: Amazon Marketplace Total Cost: $7.80 Confirmation \#: 113-882910-4452 Note: The book is confirmed for delivery by tomorrow, Sep 3rd. The order confirmation is in your email. |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

5. The Outcome:

The client approved the purchase with a single tap, saving over $29 compared to buying the new book and spending zero time on research or checkout.

### Worked Sample

**The Proactive Events Review**

1. Leo begins his daily review of his client John's inbox. He scans the dedicated "Invitations" tab and sees four invitations that have arrived over the past few days.
2. Leo opens the shared "[RSVP Event Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p0JLYDPsYYATnfya9Si-KS71Mx2pglGWRLsz6G1akO4/edit?gid=1732250470#gid=1732250470)" sheet. He methodically logs each of the four events, capturing the Event Name, Event Type, and Key Attendees. This creates a clear, documented overview before any action is taken.
3. With the tracker updated, Leo consults John's RSVP Protocol.

- The "Tech Founders Networking Dinner" and the "Family Friend's Wedding" match the "Always Accept" rule, so he RSVPs "Yes" to both and adds them to John's calendar.
- The "Vendor Product Launch Cocktail" matches the "Always Decline" rule for vendor events, so he RSVPs "No."
- The "Webinar on Fundraising Trends" falls under the "Always Ask" rule for virtual webinars, so he prepares it for the digest.

4. Leo then uses the "[Scheduling Digest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uLeKdB6K8L-m-tFOn2Mhssh9zbdCRWtHhdeZnDYlz_8/edit?usp=sharing)" template and sends the following email to John.

| Subject: Scheduling Digest for Tuesday, August 27 Hi John, Here is your scheduling digest for today, August 27. 1\.

5. The Client's Reply

"Yes to \#1."

6. John's calendar was populated with high-priority events and cleared of clutter, all managed proactively by Leo. He spent less than 10 seconds making one strategic decision, saving significant time and mental energy.

### Worked Sample

**The Long Email Thread**

1. At 8:00 AM, Leo, the XP, is scanning his client John's inbox. He sees a long email thread with the subject "_Update on Project Apollo Launch_" With 10+ replies from multiple team members, it meets John's protocol for summarization ("any thread with more than 5 replies").
2. Leo uses Superhuman's built-in AI summary feature to analyze the thread. He quickly reads the AI's output, verifies its accuracy against the key points in the email, and refines it slightly to add a nuance the AI missed. He then formulates three clear decision options for John.
   ![][image3]

He then hits "Reply All" on the latest email in the thread, immediately erases all recipients in the 'To:' and 'Cc:' fields, and pastes the following at the very top of the email draft, formatting it in red text as per John's protocol.

(Email Draft in John's Inbox)

![][image4]

3. The Chat Notification (XP sends via Slack)

| Leo (XP) \- 9:00 AM 📧 Morning Email Drafts Ready for Review Hi John, your email drafts for this morning are ready in your inbox. The key one that needs your decision is the "Project Apollo Launch" thread. I've included a summary and A/B/C options for you. |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

4. John sees the Slack notification and opens his Drafts folder. He reads the 30-second summary, then edits the pre-drafted reply to input his decision and reasoning.

![][image5]

5. Leo monitors the Drafts folder and sees that John has input his decision ("Option A"). He removes the summary/options text, and sends the finalized reply to the team on John's behalf.
   ![][image6]
6. The Outcome

John made a key decision and provided his input in under a minute, without ever having to read the long thread or even hit "Send." His XP, Leo, handled all the analysis, drafting, and final execution, allowing John to stay focused on his primary work.

| **Preferred Communication & Frequency**   | \- XP proposes the Ideal Week plan via email for client approval. \- Exceptions are handled via chat/text as they arise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **SOP \- Step by Step**                   | 1\. **Establish Protocol:** Conduct a kickoff conversation to document the client's Ideal Week priorities. 2\. **Audit Calendar:** Analyze the past 12 weeks of calendar data to find time usage patterns. 3\. **Propose Plan:** Synthesize the audit and client goals into a proposed schedule. 4\. **Client Approval:** Email the proposal and a visual of the new schedule for client feedback and approval. 5\. **Implement:** Once approved, implement recurring time blocks on the live calendar. 6\. **Manage Inbound:** Proactively manage all incoming requests according to the new protocol. |
| **Final Result**                          | The client's calendar becomes their greatest asset. Time is proactively allocated to their most important goals, creating the space to think, create, and live a balanced life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Worked Sample

**Reclaiming a CEO's Calendar**

1. John, a CEO, expresses frustration to his XP, Leo, that his weeks are purely reactive and controlled by his inbox. Leo schedules a 20-minute "Ideal Week Kickoff" call. During the call, he uses the "Ideal Week Protocol" template as a guide to ask John targeted questions. He documents John's key preferences: protecting mornings for deep work, keeping Fridays meeting-free, and blocking out family dinner and his M/W/F workouts.

2. Following the call, Leo conducts an audit of John's calendar from the past month. He discovers that 65% of John's time was spent in reactive, internal meetings, and less than 10% was available for focused work. Fridays were consistently filled with last-minute calls. Leo synthesizes these findings with John's stated goals and prepares a formal proposal email.

3. Leo sends the following email to John for his review and approval.

| Subject: Your Ideal Week: Proposal for Review Hi John, Following our conversation, I've completed an audit of your calendar. The key finding is that approximately 65% of your time is currently spent in reactive, internal meetings, with less than 10% protected for deep work. Based on this and the priorities you shared, I've created the proposed "Ideal Week" template you'll find attached. If you approve, the key changes I will implement are: Block 9 AM \- 11 AM on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays for "Deep Work." Decline any new meeting requests for Fridays to keep that day open for strategic review. Set a 15-minute buffer time between all back-to-back meetings. Permanently block 6 PM \- 8 PM on weekdays for "Family Time." Please review the attached template and let me know if you have any feedback or if I have your approval to proceed. Best, Leo |

4. The Client's Reply

"This is perfect. Please proceed."

5. The Outcome

Leo implements the changes. In the following weeks, John's calendar accurately reflects his priorities. He has protected time for strategic work, his meetings are more manageable, and his evenings are free, all because of a single 20-minute conversation and a proactive audit by his XP.

#### Worked Example

| Scenario: A client, a founder, is working towards two major Q4 goals: 1\) Launch a new product and 2\) Hire a VP of Sales. They ask their XP to implement the "Never Miss a Goal Again" playbook to ensure they make consistent daily progress.                                                                                                                  |     |

| **Step 1: Establish Goals**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| **Action:** In a kickoff meeting, the client and XP document the two major goals in a shared Goal Tracker. They agree on an 8:00 AM daily check-in via text.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| **Step 2 & 3: Daily Review & Check-In**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| **Action 1:** At 7:45 AM, the XP reviews the client's calendar and Asana board. They see a critical task, "Finalize product spec doc," is due this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| **Action 2:** At 8:00 AM, the XP sends the daily check-in message. **Template Used:** **Daily Goals Loop: Sept 9** **Yesterday's Progress:** How did you do on 'Drafting the job description'? **Today's Focus:** Based on Asana, it looks like the \#1 thing to accomplish today is '**Finalize the product spec doc**.' Does that feel right?                  |     |
| **Step 4: Update Tracker**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| **Action:** The client replies to the text, confirming the goal and their progress. The XP updates the shared Goal Tracker with the client's notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     |

#### Worked Example

| Scenario: The client, who travels frequently for work, wants to ensure their home essentials are always stocked and minor maintenance issues are handled proactively. They have a trusted housekeeper, Maria, who visits every Friday.                                                                                                                                                                               |     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Step 1: Establish Protocol**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| **Action:** Following the playbook, the XP creates a WhatsApp group chat to connect with the client and Maria, the in-home contact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
| **Action:** The XP confirms the weekly "scan" process in the chat: "Hi Maria, as discussed with the client, please send photos of the fridge and pantry every Friday morning. Thank you\!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     |
| **Action:** The client authorizes the budget as per the protocol's approval threshold: "XP, you are authorized for grocery orders up to $200".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| **Step 2 & 3: Receive Updates and Analyze**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| **Action:** Maria sends photos to the WhatsApp group. The pictures show that milk, eggs, and fresh vegetables are running low. She also sends a photo of a burnt-out lightbulb in a high-ceiling fixture.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
| **Action:** The XP analyzes these updates to create a list of needs: a grocery restock and a handyman service for the lightbulb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| **Step 4: Execute**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
| **Action:** The XP places an Instacart order for the needed groceries, totaling $162, which is within the pre-defined budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| **Action:** The XP contacts the client's pre-approved handyman service to schedule a visit for the following week to replace the lightbulb, as this falls under "routine maintenance".                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |     |
| **Step 5: Report to Client**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| **Action**: The XP sends the "Weekly Home Summary" to the client via email. **Template Used:** **Home Status Update:** Week of September 8, 2025 **Actions Taken:** Restocked pantry and fridge staples via Instacart ($162). Scheduled the handyman for Tuesday at 10 AM to replace the hallway lightbulb. **Heads-Up:** Noticed the coffee supply is about halfway. Proposing we add it to the order in two weeks. |     |
| **Final Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| The home is managed proactively in the background. The client returns from their work trip to a fully stocked kitchen and a scheduled solution for their maintenance issue, all without their direct involvement. This frees up their mental space and saves them from dealing with household chores upon their return.                                                                                              |     |

| **Step 1 & 2: Profile Created & Request Received**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     |
| **Action:** The client's master Travel Profile is already complete and approved. The client sends a brief request via email: "I need to be in NYC for meetings from October 6-8. Please book travel.".                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| **Step 3: Research & Propose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |
| **Action 1:** The XP researches options that align with the client's profile. They find a suitable Delta flight and a room at the Marriott Marquis that are both within budget.                                                                                                                                                                                            |     |
| **Action 2:** The XP sends the "Proposed Itinerary" to the client for review.

| **Action:** The client replies with "Looks great, please book it." The XP immediately books all travel components using the client's securely stored credentials.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |

#### **Worked Example**

| Scenario: The client is a busy professional who wants to maintain strong personal and professional relationships but lacks the time to track important dates and follow-ups. To solve this, the XP creates a proactive monthly "Friendship Report" that identifies key opportunities for connection and provides pre-drafted messages, turning the client's good intentions into consistent action.                                                                                                    |     |

#### **Worked Example**

| Scenario: A hiring manager at a tech company needs to quickly build a large pipeline for a new Software Engineer II role. They ask their XP to run a high-volume outreach campaign to source passive candidates who fit a specific profile.                                                                                                                        |     |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Step 1: Define Campaign**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| **Action**: The client provides the core details for the campaign to the XP. **Target Profile**: Software engineers with 3-5 years of experience using Python and AWS, preferably from other tech startups. **Sourcing Channel**: LinkedIn Sales Navigator. **Draft Message**: The client provides a brief, personalized message template for the initial outreach |     |
| **Step 2 & 3: Build List & Finalize Message**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| **Action 1**: The XP uses LinkedIn Sales Navigator to build a list of **300 qualified candidates** who match the profile, adding them to the shared Applicant Tracking System (ATS).                                                                                                                                                                               |     |
| **Action 2**: The XP refines the draft message with personalization fields and gets final approval from the client before starting the outreach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| **Step 4 & 5: Execute Outreach & Triage Replies**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
| **Action 1:** The XP systematically sends the approved, personalized message to all 300 contacts on the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| **Action 2**: As replies come in, the XP monitors the inbox and categorizes each response in the ATS (e.g., "Interested," "Not Interested").                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |
| **Step 6: Report Progress**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |     |
| **Action:** At the end of the week, the XP sends the "Candidate Pipeline Summary" to the client via Slack. **Template Used:** Sourcing Update for Software Engineer II: Week of Sept 8 Outreach Sent: 300 Responses Received: 85 Interested Candidates:22 Note: The full list of interested candidates is in the ATS for your review.                              |     |
| **Final Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
| In one week, the client generated a pipeline of 22 interested and qualified candidates. They saved dozens of hours of manual sourcing and can now spend their time on high-value interviews instead of searching for prospects.                                                                                                                                    |     |

| The client receives a **personalized operating manual** for _The E-Myth Revisited_. Instead of abstract concepts, they have a simple, 1-page guide with clear next steps. This process transforms the client's passive reading into active, strategic work on their business..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |

| **Action 1**: The XP condenses the book's core ideas into a summary of under 500 words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| **Action 2**: The XP then extracts 3 key takeaways and translates them into 3 concrete actions: **Takeaway**: Build Safety. → **Action**: "This week, start one team meeting by asking each person to share one thing they learned outside of work." **Takeaway**: Share Vulnerability. → **Action**: "In your next 1:1, share a small, recent mistake you made and what you learned from it." **Takeaway**: Establish Purpose. → **Action**: "Draft a one-sentence mission statement for the Q4 product launch and share it with the team." |     |

| The client reads the summary in less than 10 minutes during their commute. Instead of just having a vague idea of the book, they have a clear understanding of its core principles and three specific, actionable steps they can take that week to improve their team's culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |     |

#### **Worked Example**

| Scenario: A client, a venture capitalist, needs to stay updated on technology, finance, and health tech but is overwhelmed by information. They ask their XP to create a custom news digest delivered every morning, pulling from their trusted sources (WSJ, FT, TechCrunch).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     |

| **Action:** The XP delivers a concise recap to the WhatsApp group, summarizing the session's key takeaways. Recap: Practical AI for Startups Takeaway 1: Start with a small, well-defined business problem; don't try to "boil the ocean" with your first AI project. Takeaway 2: Leverage pre-trained APIs from major providers before attempting to build custom models to save significant time and resources. Takeaway 3: The quality of your training data is the single biggest predictor of success. Focus on clean, well-labeled data. |     |

| **Purpose**                              | Allow parents to rest while XP remotely supports children’s bedtime and night routines.                                                                                                                     |
| **Scope – What’s Covered**               | \- Remote supervision via Zoom or networked camera. \- Bedtime routine support (reading, calm-down activities). \- Emergency alert system if escalation needed.                                             |
| **Authority – XP Can Do Without Asking** | \- Set up nightly Zoom session. \- Read to child, keep routine on schedule. \- Call via “Freedom Phone” if escalation is needed.                                                                            |
| **Exceptions – Must Confirm**            | \- Any physical in-person care. \- Medical decisions.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Information & Tools Provided**         | \- Freedom Phone setup. \- Child’s bedtime routine \+ preferences. \- Camera/Zoom access.                                                                                                                   |

| **Preferred Communication & Frequency**  | \- Daily check-in at bedtime. \- Slack/phone alert if child cannot be calmed.                                                                                                                               |
| **SOP – Step by Step**                   | 1\. Schedule nightly Zoom session. 2\. Guide child through bedtime routine. 3\. Optional: reading time (child reads aloud). 4\. Monitor via camera. 5\. Call parent via Freedom Phone if escalation needed. |
| **Final Result**                         | Kids go to bed on time; parents sleep without worry.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Agreement**                            | Client: \_\_\_\_\_\_ XP: \_\_\_\_\_\_ Date: \_\_\_\_\_\_                                                                                                                                                    |

**Worked Example**

- Bedtime: 7:30pm. XP logs on via Zoom at 7:15.
- Child reads 20 minutes from _Charlotte’s Web_. XP encourages.
- Lights out by 8:20.
- 8:40 fussing → XP waits 10 minutes, resolves. No escalation.
- Parent evening is uninterrupted.

| **Authority – XP Can Do Without Asking** | \- Reschedule non-essential meetings if sleep score is low. \- Prioritize deep work/workouts if score is high.                                                                                                      |
| **Exceptions – Must Confirm**            | \- Canceling client-facing external meetings.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **SOP – Step by Step**                   | 1\. Sync sleep score at 6:00am. 2\. If low → move non-essential meetings, shorten day. 3\. If high → add deep work, workout, or stretch goals. 4\. Update calendar by 6:30am. 5\. Notify client with adjusted plan. |
| **Final Result**                         | Client’s energy is matched to the right work and recovery daily.                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Worked Sample

6:00 AM: Client's Oura ring reports a low sleep score of 65\.
6:15 AM: XP syncs the data, postpones two non-essential internal meetings to the next day, and blocks a 30-minute recovery period in the afternoon calendar.
6:30 AM: Client receives a Slack update with their adjusted, lighter schedule, allowing them to prioritize recovery without missing critical work.

| **Exceptions – Must Confirm**            | \- Intros involving board members, investors, or highly sensitive relationships. \- Opportunities with potential conflicts.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Information & Tools Provided**         | \- Client’s personal CRM (Clay/LinkedIn). \- Content feeds (HBR, McKinsey, industry newsletters). \- Client’s resource preferences (articles, books, podcasts).                                                                                                                                               |
| **Approval Thresholds**                  | \- Routine intros/resources → proceed with client review. \- VIP-level introductions → explicit client approval.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## **Quick-Start Guide**

### **🎯 Purpose of This Playbook**

This Delegation Playbook defines the rules, boundaries, and workflows that make executive delegation effortless. Each protocol sets what success looks like, what’s off-limits, and how your XP executes independently — so you stay focused on high-impact leadership.

### **🛠 How to Use**

1. **Choose a Domain** → Travel, Inbox, Calendar, Payments, Projects, etc.
2. **Fill the Template Together** → Client provides preferences \+ rules; XP captures details.
3. **Sign Off** → Both confirm agreement at the bottom.
4. **Store in Shared Folder** → All protocols live in one Playbook file.
5. **Review Quarterly** → Update thresholds, tools, or preferences as needs evolve.

### **✅ Why It Works**

- **Clarity** → No ambiguity about authority, exceptions, or tools.
- **Consistency** → Every task follows the same SOP structure.
- **Control** → Approval thresholds \+ reporting rules keep you in charge without micromanaging.
- **Confidence** → Client and XP work from the same playbook, aligned and accountable.

| SOP                   | Matching Protocol            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Inbox Triage          | Urgent Email Escalation      |
| Calendar Optimization | Schedule Change              |
| Trip Planning         | Travel Disruption            |
| Expense Submission    | Fraud or Overbudget Handling |
| Client Prep           | Crisis or Complaint Handling |

This pairing ensures you’ve delegated both **consistency** _and_ **judgment** — the hallmark of executive-level delegation.
