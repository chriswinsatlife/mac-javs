# Client Journey & Milestones

## All

| Area | Details | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Y2 | Beyond |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | Themes | Making Investments & Embracing Failures | Iterating Systems & Playbooks | Empowerment & Experimentation | Expanding Scope & Complexity | Shifting to Offense & Outcomes | Full EA Involvement & Unlocking Leverage | Scaling Ambition, Leverage, & Personal Team |
|  | Client | Sharing context, providing feedback, making mistakes | Delegating by process, not by tasks; sharing goals & thought process | Expanding delegation across personal & business areas; recursive leverage | Enabling EA to think/act the same way you would across the board | Taking self out of the loop, pushing limits & upskilling EA | Delegating as a reflex, bulletproofing systems, coaching EA proactivity | Main EA as liaison with key people and taking point on new projects, hiring 2nd/3rd+ EA |
|  | EA | Learning by immersion, nailing the basics, developing the relationship | Looking for ways to add value without client as bottleneck; putting things on autopilot | Being more autonomous, expanding skill set and role definition; being involved in more areas | Taking things off the client's plate; getting things done without client always in-the-loop | Aiming to execute some things without review / approval, shifting towards proactivity | Basics fully on autopilot; starting to co-own client goals and work with key people to make it happen | Being the right hand and connective fabric with a broader team, onto new projects & adventures |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Goals | Dynamic | Taking two steps back to take 10 steps forward; learning the ropes | Starting to experience leverage in basic areas; developing feedback loops & relationship | EA consistently nailing email voice, scheduling, and preferences; moving beyond the basics | Mundane work almost fully handed off; most time spent in zone of genius; EA owning more and more | Several key business and personal workflows nearly all on autopilot; starting to experience long-term benefits like clairvoyance | Delegating less, but achieving more; EA dynamic more "push" than "pull"; magic starting to happen | Delegating delegation itself; trending toward broader and recursive leverage |
|  | Skillls | Delegate both personal / business; test waters with "easy" playbooks; experiment w/ task system, voice notes, Loom, etc | Move beyond the basics of inbox / calendar / travel / etc; Aggressively invest in recurring delegations + playbooks | Start removing self as bottleneck; find ways to limit delegating by task; empower EA to create automations/playbooks | Delegate by sharing outcomes/goals, EA providing process / ideas + working with others | Empower EA to execute within limits; e.g. purchases/comms without approval, etc | Delegating by process and goal now lion's share; invest in enabling proactivity & guiding EA's autonomous work | Leverage main EA in hub-and-spoke model with other EAs & new personnel |
|  | Relationship | Share tons of access / context; over-invest in giving feedback | Involve EA in key communications / relationships; share nuances of preferences | Inject EA into more workflows in more areas; start EA's upskilling journey | Experiment with EA hiring contractors, coaches/experts, etc to pursue goals | EA upskilling in other roles/areas enabling more aggressive leverage | Utilize EA as co-pilot for personal / professional goals; develop skill roadmap | Start thinking bigger; use EA leverage on toward new ventures & goals |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Experience | Reality | Short-term pain, but experiencing early wins | Honing basic delegation skills, developing playbooks | Going beyond the basics, starting to see the magic | Reaching a leverage inflection point | Nearing complete integration | Symbiotic relationship; complete mind-meld | Experiencing limitless potential |
|  | Description | Delegation is a skill; no progress without mistakes | Investments starting to pay off, but still super early | Delegation mental models beginning to take hold | Provactivity more common; delegation becoming reflexive | EA nearly able to mimic client's thought process | Delegation nearly effortless; complete trust | Redefining personal possibilities & leverage |
|  | Thought Process | "This is harder than I thought, but will be worth it for long-term leverage." | "Okay, I'm starting to get it. We can do this." | "How can I involve [EA] in X more? Can this be a playbook?" | "The vibe is really shifting." | "This is magical. How do people live without an EA?" | "With [EA], anything is possible." | "I could be doing more. What's next?" |
|  | Typical Delegations | Inbox, Calendar, Travel | + Gifts, Relationships, a few work areas (e.g. recruiting) | + Physical/Mental Health, Finance, Learning, & many key professional workflows | + Passion Projects, Bucket List; most core work roles & processes | Nearly all work-related activity in some way; EA involvement in most personal goals | All areas, business + personal; differences in depth / complexity / impact—not scope | Delegating delegation; "Work with person X or hire person Y to make Z happen" |
