## The Productivity Effects of Generative AI

[Image: Two rounded white text boxes on a black background. The top box contains the research paper title "Experimental Evidence on the Productivity Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence" with authors Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, both from MIT. The larger bottom box contains a quote summarizing the findings: "The ChatGPT using group was 37% faster at completing tasks (17 minutes to complete vs. 27 minutes) with roughly similar grades (level of quality), and as the workers repeated their tasks for improvement the ChatGPT groups quality went up significantly faster. In other words, ChatGPT did make work speedier with no sacrifice in quality and then made it easier to 'improve work quickly' using the tool."]

## AI in Recruitment: A Chat Exchange

[Image: A series of chat bubbles on a dark background showing a conversation.
- Top left, a white bubble from "Carlos Lucero" states "Reply to chrisyork".
- Below it, another white bubble: "He doesn't even know he was recruited by a large language model".
- To its right, a smaller gray box, seemingly a snippet of an email, is titled "Next Steps" with recipients "Eli Myers" and "Chris York", and a timestamp "5:13 PM". The email text starts "Hey Chris! I'm equally excited and really enjoyed meeting the rest of the team. Overall I get a great feeling from the folks I chatted with and agree, I think we can do some meaningful work together! Riva strongly aligns with what I'm looking for in my next step and just have a few remaining questions on my side I'd love to dig in in on. I'll plan to send those over tonight to ensure I have the same level of clarity on my end and we can determine what the".
- Below the white bubbles, a gray bubble with "CL" initials says "And they said AI was gonna take jobs away 沽 lol" with a timestamp "18:44".
- Below that, a blue chat bubble (sent by the user) says "In fairness it did take our recruiter's job away" with a timestamp "18:44" and a checkmark.

## Summarizing Example 1: Using the Chunking Method to Summarize any Book or Long Text

[Image: Two code/workflow diagrams side-by-side on a dark background.
- **Left (Method 1: Simple LangChain Setup)**: A Python code block.
    - Imports `os`, `OpenAI` from `langchain.llms`, `load_summarize_chain` from `langchain.chains.summarize`, `TextLoader`, `UnstructuredEPubLoader` from `langchain.document_loaders`, `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain.text_splitter`.
    - Initializes `llm` with `OpenAI` using `temperature=1` and `openai_api_key`.
    - Loads a document using `UnstructuredEPubLoader` for 'Outlive_-_Peter_Attia_MD.epub'.
    - Defines `text_splitter` as `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `chunk_size=4000`, `chunk_overlap=500`.
    - Splits documents into `texts`.
    - Initializes `chain` with `load_summarize_chain` using `llm`, `chain_type="map_reduce"`, `verbose=True`.
    - Runs the chain on the first few texts.
- **Right (Method 2: No-Code via Zapier)**: A Zapier workflow titled "OpenAI Webpage Summarizer".
    - Steps include: "1. New Meeting in Fireflies.ai" (Trigger), "2. Split Texts Into Chunks for AI Prompts (beta)" (Action), "3. Loop Through All Chunks" (Action), "4. Set Delay Before Every Loop" (Action), "5. Ask for a summary of each chunk via GPT4" (Action), "6. Save each chunk to a list via Digest by Zapier" (Action), "7. Filter step (only proceed if loop has ended)" (Action), "8. Retrieve all chunks" (Action), "9. Create a summary of summaries via GPT4" (Action), "10. Save summary to Notion" (Action).]

## Summarizing 'Outlive' for Action Items

[Image: The left half of the slide shows the cover of a book titled "OUTLIVE: THE SCIENCE & ART OF LONGEVITY" by Peter Attia, MD with Bill Gifford, subtitled "RETHINKING MEDICINE TO LIVE BETTER LONGER". The cover has a vibrant rainbow gradient. The right half of the slide contains a white text bubble with a prompt: ""Summarize this book, extract the action items, find ways to delegate them to my EA, then create a JSON payload for our task manager and send via API.""]

## Example 2: Summarize a 2-day health webinar

Using a few lines of code (all copy-pasted from LangChain docs) the EA was able to summarize a 2-day webinar by the NIH on 'Transforming Hypertension Diagnosis and Management in the Era of Artificial Intelligence'

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

llm = OpenAI(temperature=1, openai_api_key=)

loader = TextLoader('Desktop/NHLBI_transcript.txt')
documents = loader.load()

# Get your splitter ready
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=200)

#Split your docs into texts
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce", verbose=True)
chain.run(texts[:5])
```
[Image: A screenshot of a Python code editor displaying the LangChain code for summarizing a long document. The code imports `OpenAI`, `load_summarize_chain`, `TextLoader`, and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. It initializes an OpenAI LLM, loads a transcript from 'Desktop/NHLBI_transcript.txt', splits the text into chunks of 2000 characters with 200 overlap, and then runs a "map_reduce" summarization chain on the first 5 text chunks.]

## AI Delegation Expansion Workshop

Uses chain prompts to improve bad delegations. We do this to make it easier for EAs and clients to collaborate, even when clients don't provide great context or detail in their delegations.

[Image: A table with three primary columns: "Inputs", "Input Data", and "Identity Prompt". The "Identity Prompt" column is followed by two additional columns that seem to elaborate on the prompt: "How can we go above and beyond in completing this task?" and "What else can we do outside the task desc based on the quarterly goal, to provide ma value?".
- **Inputs**: "Delegation"
- **Input Data**: "Create Tango of Clay / Airtable + OpenAI automated recruiting messages playbook"
- **Identity Prompt** (and subsequent columns repeat this persona text): "You are a world-class chief of staff who always goes above and beyond what's asked of you. You specialize in intuiting the next steps for any given task, and finding the highest-leverage way to accomplish the goal implied by any task. You're particularly skilled at leveraging AI, no-code tools, automation, business process design, and delegating to offshore executive assistants (EA) to drive maximum ROI. Your goal when receiving a task is to do it in a way that people think: "Wow, that's more than I could've expected. 11/10.""
- Below the identity prompt, specific sections are detailed for "TASK", "QUARTERLY GOAL", "COMPANY DESCRIPTION", and "PROMPT" for each of the expanded columns.]

## Automated Daily Note & Weekly Review

LLMs can analyze client tasks, calendar, etc and suggest high-leverage tasks based on goals, ideas to get started / breakdown of tasks on client's existing to-do list, and things to delegate to their EA.

### Step 1: We use Zapier to extract tasks (completed and in-progress), as well as client's calendar events. We output the data points to Notion/Coda

[Image: Two Zapier workflow snippets side-by-side on a dark background.
- **Left Workflow (Calendar Events to Daily No...)**:
    - **Trigger**: "1. GCal trigger to extract tomorrow's events"
    - **Action**: "2. Append to list and release full list every 8pm"
    - **Action**: "3. Create Row in Coda"
- **Right Workflow (untitled)**:
    - **Action**: "4. GET request to Ticktick API to extract tasks"
    - **Action**: "5. Create Row in Coda"]

---

## Automated Daily Note & Weekly Review - AI Analysis

### Step 2: Use LLMs to analyze the data points, extract high-value tasks, and delegate ideas to both client and EA. In this example, we use Coda AI to create AI prompt boxes that automatically generate new completions whenever our data points are updated.

[Image: A white text box titled "Ideas & Suggested High Leverage Tasks Based on Goals:".
- **Idea**: Develop a system for tracking and analyzing sales data to optimize the sales process
- **Goal worked on**: "The quarterly goal of achieving $100k MRR on BeSci Course"
- **Step-by-step breakdown**:
    1. Identify key metrics to track (e.g. conversion rates, lead sources, sales cycle length)
    2. Set up a system for tracking and analyzing these metrics (e.g. using a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce)
    3. Regularly review and analyze the data to identify areas for improvement
    4. Implement changes to the sales process based on the data analysis (e.g. adjusting lead sources, refining sales pitch, etc.)
- **Implied action steps**: Regularly review and analyze sales data to ensure that the sales process is optimized
- **Possible improvements**: Use AI-powered analytics tools like Gong or Chorus to automatically analyze sales calls and provide insights on areas for improvement.]

## Vectorstore embeddings power-up your EA to do more with LLMs that are trained on your custom data

Apps like Baseplate or Vectara allow you to easily create an index of sources that you can connect with via an API request in Zapier. This allows you to create a Q&A chatbot on any messaging app you are using.

[Image: A Zapier workflow titled "Baseplate Slackbot".
- **Trigger**: "1. When there's a new message in "content-team""
- **Action**: "2. Ping the Baseplate API"
- **Action**: "3. Post a message in "content-team""]
