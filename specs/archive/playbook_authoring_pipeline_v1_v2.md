# Playbook Authoring Pipeline V1 And V2

Goal: AI generates Athena playbook articles plus diagrams and supporting visual assets, in a repeatable directory structure, with an Astro component layer for consistent presentation.

This spec assumes:

- Playbooks are authored as MDX.
- Diagrams are authored as Mermaid flowcharts and rendered to branded SVG (SVG-only; no PNG/JPEG diagram outputs).

MDX integration note:

- The current root `package.json` does not include `@astrojs/mdx` yet. Serving playbooks as MDX pages will require adding that integration when implementing this spec.

## Context In This Repo

- Existing diagram renderer: superseded/removed.
- Renderer docs and frontmatter knobs: `dataviz/mermaid_js/README_flowrender.md`
- Current shared CSS (sketch-oriented): `dataviz/mermaid_js/styles/flowchart.css`
- Current renderer notes in this spec are historical; current direction is SVG-only outputs.

Problem observed in legacy playbook exports:

- Some playbook docs embed base64 images (hard to diff, huge files). Example: `athena/Playbooks_AK Copy.md`.

## Definitions

- Playbook article: an MDX file that renders as a page.
- Diagram source: a Mermaid flowchart (stored as text) used to generate SVG.
- Rendered diagram: generated `.svg` that is embedded inline in the article.
- Playbook assets: all non-text assets referenced by the playbook (diagrams, screenshots, generated illustrations, etc).
- Slug: URL-safe identifier for a playbook (example: `gift-automation`).

## Design Principles

- Deterministic builds: diagrams and images are generated assets, committed to the repo (or generated in CI) so the site build does not need a headless browser.
- AI-friendly: the AI writes small, reviewable files (MDX + diagram source text), not opaque base64 blobs.
- Consistent presentation: all diagrams/images in MDX go through a small set of Astro components.
- Per-playbook locality: everything needed for a playbook lives under its folder.

## Directory Structure

V1 introduces a single canonical layout under `athena/playbooks/`.

- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/playbook.mdx`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/diagrams_src/`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/diagrams/`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/images_src/`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/images/`
- `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/manifest.json`

Asset serving note:

- Astro only serves files under `public/` by default.
- V1 assumes a build step (or sync script) copies `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/**` to `public/playbooks/<slug>/assets/**` so MDX can reference `/playbooks/<slug>/assets/...`.

Notes:

- `*_src/` holds editable sources (Mermaid text, prompt inputs, etc).
- Rendered assets are placed in `assets/diagrams/` and `assets/images/`.
- `manifest.json` is the machine-readable index used for v2 features (copy/share) and future automation.

## Diagram Source Format

Each diagram source is a standalone file in `assets/diagrams_src/`.

- File extension: `.md` (preferred) or `.mmd`
- Optional YAML frontmatter for layout/styling overrides.
- First Mermaid fenced block is the diagram definition.

The frontmatter keys should match what the renderer already supports (see `dataviz/mermaid_js/README_flowrender.md` and `dataviz/mermaid_js/src/cli/flowrender.js`):

- `rankdir`, `nodesep`, `ranksep`, `startGap`, `endGap`, `labelOffset`
- typography: `fontFamily`, `fontMinPx`, `fontMaxPx`, `fontWeight`
- styling: `stroke`, `fill` (renderer currently maps these to node stroke/fill)

## Rendering Pipeline

### V1 Rendering Requirement

Render diagrams to SVG via a CLI step, not at Astro build time.

The current entry point is:

- `bun --prefix dataviz run render:all`

However, Athena should not ship the Rough.js visual style.

### V1 Renderer Changes

Create an Athena-specific renderer that keeps the same Mermaid+AST+Dagre approach but draws clean SVG primitives.

Files to add/change:

- Add `dataviz/mermaid_js/src/cli/flowrender_athena.js`
- Add `dataviz/mermaid_js/styles/athena_flowchart.css`
- Update `dataviz/package.json` scripts:
    - add `flowrender:athena` and `flowrender:athena:all`

Renderer behavior changes vs `dataviz/mermaid_js/src/cli/flowrender.js`:

- Remove Rough.js (`roughjs`) dependency and drawing calls.
- Replace node drawing with SVG primitives:
    - rect nodes: `<rect>` with `rx/ry`
    - diamond nodes: `<polygon>`
    - ellipse nodes: `<ellipse>`
- Replace edge drawing with a single `<path>` per edge, with a `<marker>` arrowhead.
- Embed a `<style>` block into the output SVG that references CSS variables (tokens) defined in `athena_flowchart.css`.
- Avoid external CDN dependencies in the renderer page HTML.
    - Avoid heavyweight browser installs in the build pipeline.
    - Prefer bundling required JS modules via Node rather than loading `d3/dagre/mermaid` from CDNs.

Output targets per diagram:

- `assets/diagrams/<diagram>.svg` (primary)

## Astro Component Layer

V1 uses components as presentation wrappers around generated assets.

Repo integration note:

- `astro.config.mjs` defines `@components` as an alias to `./components`.
- This spec places playbook presentation components under `components/playbooks/` so they can be imported from MDX via `@components/playbooks/...`.

## Serving Playbooks In Astro

This spec focuses on authoring and assets, but playbooks need a page route.

V1 recommended approach (simple, no content collections required):

- Treat `athena/playbooks/<slug>/playbook.mdx` as the source of truth.
- Create a build-time copy step that writes MDX into `src/pages/playbooks/<slug>.mdx` (or `src/content/playbooks/<slug>.mdx` once `@astrojs/mdx` is installed).

Files to add (implementation):

- Add `scripts/sync_playbooks_to_site.mjs`
    - reads `athena/playbooks/**/playbook.mdx`
    - writes to `src/pages/playbooks/<slug>.mdx` (or `src/content/playbooks/<slug>.mdx`)
    - copies assets to `public/playbooks/<slug>/assets/**`

Rationale:

- Keeps Astro build fast and deterministic.
- Avoids having Astro reach outside the project tree for MDX and raw asset files.

### Diagram Component

Create `components/playbooks/Diagram.astro`.

Responsibilities:

- Consistent figure layout (spacing, border, caption).
- Responsive sizing.
- Optional metadata affordances that can be expanded in v2.

Proposed props:

- `src` (string, required) : site-root path to SVG (example: `/playbooks/<slug>/assets/diagrams/workflow.svg`)
- `alt` (string, required)
- `title` (string, optional)
- `caption` (string, optional)

Implementation note:

- Render diagrams as inline SVG (no `<img>`, no iframes, no scroll/zoom UI).

### Image Component

Create `components/playbooks/PlaybookImage.astro`.

Responsibilities:

- Consistent image presentation and captions.
- Prevent base64 blobs in MDX by standardizing on file paths.
- Provide future hooks for attribution and downloads.

Proposed props:

- `src` (string, required)
- `alt` (string, required)
- `title` (string, optional)
- `caption` (string, optional)
- `credit` (string, optional)
- `creditUrl` (string, optional)
- `download` (boolean, default false)

## How AI Generates A Playbook

V1 generation contract (what the AI writes to disk):

- Create folder `athena/playbooks/<slug>/`.
- Write `athena/playbooks/<slug>/playbook.mdx`.
- Write one or more diagram sources to `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/diagrams_src/*.md`.
- Write or place image sources into `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/images_src/`.
- Write `athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/manifest.json` with all referenced assets.

Then run rendering (local or CI):

- Render each `diagrams_src/*.md` to:
    - `assets/diagrams/<name>.svg`
- Generate images (if AI-generated) into `assets/images/<name>.<ext>`.

MDX authoring pattern:

```mdx
import Diagram from "@components/playbooks/Diagram.astro";
import PlaybookImage from "@components/playbooks/PlaybookImage.astro";

<Diagram
    src="/playbooks/gift-automation/assets/diagrams/gift-automation-workflow.svg"
    alt="Gift automation workflow"
    caption="A high-level workflow for identifying moments, selecting gifts, and executing orders."
/>

<PlaybookImage
    src="/playbooks/gift-automation/assets/images/gift-guidelines.png"
    alt="Gift guidelines card"
    caption="Guidelines for personalization, budget, and timing."
/>
```

## Manifest Schema

`athena/playbooks/<slug>/assets/manifest.json` exists to make v2 features reliable.

V1 fields (minimum):

- `schema_version` (number)
- `slug` (string)
- `title` (string)
- `diagrams` (array)
    - `id` (string)
    - `src_mermaid` (string) : repo-relative path to diagram source
    - `src_svg` (string) : repo-relative path to rendered svg
    - `alt` (string)
    - `caption` (string, optional)
- `images` (array)
    - `id` (string)
    - `src` (string)
    - `alt` (string)
    - `caption` (string, optional)

## V1 Deliverables

- File layout under `athena/playbooks/<slug>/...` as described.
- `components/playbooks/Diagram.astro`.
- `components/playbooks/PlaybookImage.astro`.
- Athena renderer skeleton `dataviz/mermaid_js/src/cli/flowrender_athena.js` and style tokens `dataviz/mermaid_js/styles/athena_flowchart.css`.
- A scriptable command that renders all playbook diagrams into their playbook folders (either by discovery in `athena/playbooks/**/assets/diagrams_src/*.md` or by reading each playbook manifest).
- A sync step that makes playbooks and assets available to the Astro site (`scripts/sync_playbooks_to_site.mjs`).

## V2 Enhancements

V2 adds interactive affordances without changing the authoring model.

### V2 Diagram Features

- Copy-to-clipboard:
    - copy Mermaid source
    - copy a markdown snippet that embeds the diagram component
- Download options:
    - SVG
    - PNG
- Social sharing preparation:
    - generate a share-optimized PNG (fixed width, optional background)
    - optional OG image per playbook

Implementation approach:

- Publish the Mermaid source to the client in one of these ways:
    - Option A: copy `assets/diagrams_src/*.md` into `assets/diagrams_public_src/*.mmd` during build
    - Option B: embed Mermaid source in `manifest.json` (small diagrams only)
    - Option C: serve raw source via an internal route (if SSR exists later)

### V2 Component Changes

Update `components/playbooks/Diagram.astro`:

- Add UI controls (copy, download) that read from the manifest and/or the published source.
- Optionally inline SVG (via `set:html`) to enable theme-aware styling adjustments.

Add `components/playbooks/AssetActions.astro` (optional):

- Shared control strip for download/copy/share across diagrams and images.

### V2 Image Features

- Standardize image variants:
    - original
    - optimized web format (webp/avif)
    - optional thumbnail
- Add optional "copy prompt" support for AI-regenerating an image when the source is generative.

## Open Questions (Need Decisions)

- Where playbooks are ultimately served from in Astro:
    - content collections under `src/content/playbooks/` vs direct routes reading `athena/playbooks/**`.
- Whether SVGs must be theme-aware (dark mode). If yes, prefer inlining SVG and/or embedding media-query styles in SVG output.
- Whether generated assets are committed to the repo or generated in CI and published as artifacts.

## Update

Exactly. Multi-step pipeline:

```
STEP 1: Generate Playbook JSON
├── AI outputs structured content
├── Validated against Zod schema
├── Contains placeholders/references for diagrams
│   "diagram": { "id": "workflow", "description": "Show gift flow from trigger to delivery" }

STEP 2: Generate Diagrams
├── AI reads playbook JSON
├── For each diagram reference, generates Mermaid source
├── Outputs: assets/diagrams_src/workflow.mmd

STEP 3: Render Diagrams
├── CLI renders .mmd → .svg
├── No AI, deterministic
├── Outputs: assets/diagrams/workflow.svg

STEP 4: Generate Images (optional)
├── AI generates illustrations based on playbook context
├── Outputs: assets/images/hero.png
```

Benefits:

- Each step is reviewable/retriable independently
- Different models for different tasks (Claude for writing, image model for visuals)
- Step 3 is pure tooling, no AI variance
- Parallelizable (diagrams + images can generate concurrently)
- Schema validates early (step 1), before expensive diagram/image generation

The JSON schema just needs diagram **intents**, not sources:

```json
{
    "diagrams": [
        {
            "id": "gift-workflow",
            "placement": "section:what-elite-looks-like",
            "intent": "Show flow: trigger event → EA researches → client picks → gift sent → thank you received",
            "style": "flowchart-td"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then step 2 AI reads that intent and writes the actual Mermaid.
