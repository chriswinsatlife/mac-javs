# Websites Cataloging Personal Stacks, Routines, and Setups

Below is a comprehensive list of sites and communities (over 30 examples) that collect or showcase individuals’ tools, habits, gear, and workflows, organized by category:

## 1. **Tool Stacks / Software Setups**  

- **Tool Finder (toolfinder.co)** – A directory of real people’s productivity stacks. It features 100+ case studies of the software tools people (from startup founders to hobbyists) use daily ([toolfinder.co](https://toolfinder.co/?_bhlid=5891d8fe8ee1027c6c398b0f428cd4fe1da93b59#:~:text=100%2B%20Real)). Users can browse these curated “stacks” to discover new apps and workflows.  

- **Share My Stack (sharemystack.com)** – A platform for curating and sharing your personal tech stack. Users create profiles listing their favorite productivity or development tools, and explore others’ stacks for inspiration ([sharemystack.com](https://sharemystack.com/#:~:text=Curate%20your%20personal%20productivity%20stack,inspired%20to%20try%20new%20tools)).  

- **UsesThis (usesthis.com)** – Also known as *The Setup*, this site is an interview series where developers, designers, writers, and other creatives share the hardware and software they use to get their work done ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40becomingguru/hardware-and-software-you-should-use-today-128048074e9f#:~:text=The%20Setup%20is%20a%20site,The%20latest)). With hundreds of interviews archived, it’s a goldmine of individual “gear and software” lists.  

- **StackShare (stackshare.io)** – A popular community for sharing technology stacks. While often focused on company tech stacks, individuals (especially developers) also use StackShare to list the programming languages, APIs, and apps they personally use. It doubles as a tool discovery platform, showing which tools are trending or commonly paired together.  

- **StackRadar/StackFinder** – Sites like StackRadar (blog posts on Medium) and StackFinder provide curated lists of software for specific roles or purposes (e.g. a “personal productivity tech stack”). These aren’t personal profiles, but they aggregate tool recommendations drawn from what people are using in the wild ([medium.com](https://medium.com/stackradar/the-personal-productivity-tech-stack-a00520e3c5ae#:~:text=Medium%20medium,Structure%20and%20save%20your%20time)).

## 2. **Daily Routines / Habits**  

- **Routines.club** – An archive of daily routines and rituals of influential people. It invites you to *“uncover the daily routines of influential leaders, creators, and visionaries”* and learn from their schedule and habit insights ([routines.club](https://routines.club/#:~:text=Uncover%20the%20daily%20routines%20of,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20most%20accomplished%20individuals)). You can filter routines by goals (productivity, fitness, etc.) and read detailed breakdowns of morning, afternoon, and evening habits.  

- **Good Routine Club (goodroutineclub.com)** – Focuses on “routines of the world’s most fascinating minds,” including their daily rituals, workout schedules, and diets ([www.goodroutineclub.com](https://www.goodroutineclub.com/#:~:text=Daily%20rituals%2C%20workouts%20%26%20diets,that%20really%20work)). Each profile (e.g. Andrew Huberman’s routine) covers that person’s habits across the entire day – from morning routines to exercise, nutrition, and sleep ([www.goodroutineclub.com](https://www.goodroutineclub.com/#:~:text=Dr,his%20meticulously%20crafted%20sleep%20routine)).  

- **GotRoutines (gotroutines.com)** – A niche site emphasizing celebrity and influencer routines. It spotlights *“Daily Routines & Habits of the Rich and Famous”* ([gotroutines.com](https://gotroutines.com/#:~:text=Daily%20Routines%20%26%20Habits%20of,the%20Rich%20and%20Famous)) – from CEOs’ productivity rituals to actors’ skincare and wellness habits. It often includes categories like morning rituals, beauty routines, and other personal habit systems of public figures.  

- **Balance The Grind – “A Day in the Life” Series** – An interview series on balancethegrind.co profiling people’s work-life balance and daily schedules. They’ve interviewed over 2,000 individuals across different careers about their *daily work habits, routines and schedules* ([balancethegrind.co](https://balancethegrind.co/day-in-the-life/#:~:text=For%20our%20interview%20series%2C%20Balance,work%20habits%2C%20routines%20and%20schedules)). The site organizes these interviews by role/profession, letting you see what a typical day looks like for a CEO vs. a developer vs. an artist, etc.  

- **My Morning Routine (mymorningroutine.com)** – An independent online magazine (now archived/retired) that, for 6+ years, published a new morning routine every Wednesday ([www.producthunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com/products/my-morning-routine#:~:text=My%20Morning%20Routine%20is%20a,six%20and%20a%20half%20years)). Each entry was an interview with someone about how they start their day – covering wake-up times, exercise, breakfast, planning tools, and more. (It was popular enough to become a book in 2018.) The archive is a trove of morning habit examples from entrepreneurs, writers, and other high achievers.

## 3. **Desk Setups / Workspaces / Gear**  

- **Workspaces.xyz** – A showcase of modern desk setups and workstations. The site offers *weekly tours of real desk setups from designers, founders, and builders* ([www.workspaces.xyz](https://www.workspaces.xyz/#:~:text=Weekly%20tours%20of%20real%20desk,Sent%20every%20Saturday)). Each feature includes photos and descriptions of the person’s workspace and gear. You can browse categories like “minimal setups,” “plant-filled setups,” or “multi-monitor setups,” and new setups are published every Saturday via their newsletter.  

- **Desk Hunt (deskhunt.com)** – A community-driven gallery of inspirational workspaces. Desk Hunt publishes user-submitted desk setup tours, often in interview format (e.g. the site might interview the submitter about their custom home office desk and workflow) as seen in their archives. It’s an early site in this niche that has catalogued many home office setups from around the world.  

- **DeskSetups.net** – An online gallery where people can **submit their own desk setup** to be showcased ([desksetups.net](https://desksetups.net/submit-setup#:~:text=Showcase%20your%20desk%20setup%20to,community%27s%20gallery%20of%20curated%20workspaces)). It’s essentially a curated collection of workstation photos and descriptions. Users share details like their desk furniture, PC components, peripherals, and other gear, creating a library of setup inspiration.  

- **Reddit – r/battlestations** – A massive Reddit community (over 5 million members) dedicated to sharing battlestations (computer desk setups) ([gummysearch.com](https://gummysearch.com/r/battlestations/#:~:text=alternatives%20here.%20,the%20community%20is%20massive%20in)). Users post photos of their rigs – from elaborate RGB-lit gaming setups to minimalist coding stations – often listing their hardware and accessories in the comments. It’s a great place to see everyday tech workspaces and get ideas on gear and arrangement.  

- **Reddit – r/Workspaces or r/desksetup** – Other subreddits like r/Workspaces and r/desksetup are focused on general workspace aesthetics and productivity setups. These communities are slightly smaller than r/battlestations but still active, featuring everything from home office corners to studio desks. (There’s even r/unixporn for Linux users to show off their desktop UI customizations – see category 7.)  

- **Lifehacker’s Featured Workspaces** – (Honorable mention) Lifehacker used to regularly feature impressive user-submitted workspace photos on their site. While not a dedicated site of its own, this long-running series exposed readers to tons of clever desk setups, often including lists of the gear and apps shown. Searching “Lifehacker featured workspace” will yield examples of these posts.

## 4. **Workout Routines of Specific People**  

- **Superhero Jacked** – Perhaps the largest online database of celebrity workout routines and diets. It boasts *“the most comprehensive database of free celebrity workout routines anywhere”* ([superherojacked.com](https://superherojacked.com/celebrity-workout-routines/#:~:text=Superhero%20Jacked%27s%20Celebrity%20Workout%20Routines)) with hundreds of entries. The site covers how actors (e.g. Marvel superheroes), athletes, and other famous figures train, often providing full workout programs inspired by those individuals.  

- **BasedHealth – Celebrity Workouts** – BasedHealth.ai has a *“Celebrity Workout Routines”* section that lets you **train like your favorite stars with their exact workout plans and diet protocols** ([www.basedhealth.ai](https://www.basedhealth.ai/workouts#:~:text=Train%20like%20your%20favorite%20stars,workout%20plans%20and%20diet%20protocols)). The routines here are “expert verified” and include featured programs (e.g. Andrew Tate’s routine, Sylvester Stallone’s routine) with structured exercise plans and nutrition guidelines.  

- **Jacked Gorilla** – A fitness site that has an extensive collection of workout routine posts (and accompanying diet plans) for bodybuilders, models, actors, and influencers. Each article is titled “__Person__’s Workout Routine” and breaks down their training split, specific exercises, and sometimes supplement use. Jacked Gorilla functions as an archive of individual fitness routines – from Hollywood celebrities to YouTube fitness personalities.  

- **Fitness Clone – Fitness Profiles** – FitnessClone.com aggregates profiles of top performers in sports, entertainment, and business, detailing each person’s workout routine, diet, supplement stack, and lifestyle. As their *Fitness Profiles* intro says, you can "*discover the workout routines, diets, supplements, and lifestyles of top performers in every industry.*” ([fitnessclone.com](https://fitnessclone.com/profiles/#:~:text=FITNESS%20PROFILES)). It’s a one-stop resource to see how, say, an Olympic athlete’s regimen differs from an actor’s or an entrepreneur’s fitness routine.  

- **Bodybuilding & Celebrity Fitness Blogs** – (General) Many fitness blogs and magazines have sections for celebrity workouts. For example, Muscle & Fitness, Men’s Health, and Bodybuilding.com often publish the training routines of movie stars or athletes preparing for roles or competitions. While not dedicated archives, over years they’ve accumulated a lot of individual routines (e.g. “The Rock’s Leg Day Routine” or “Serena Williams’ Training Plan”). These can be found via search or site navigation on those publications.

## 5. **Diet / Nutrition Protocols of Individuals**  

- **Fitness Clone – Diets & Supplements** – As mentioned above, FitnessClone’s profiles always include the person’s diet and nutrition habits in addition to workouts. You can learn what a given celebrity eats on an average day, what dieting style they follow (keto, vegan, intermittent fasting, etc.), and what supplements they take. This makes it a useful resource for diet protocols of famous individuals, not just their exercises.  

- **Superhero Jacked – Celebrity Diets** – SuperheroJacked.com complements its workout database with content on celebrities’ diets. For instance, they’ve analyzed the top diets among famous people (showing how different stars use approaches like Paleo, plant-based, etc.) and provided specific meal plans for certain actors. If you’re curious how celebrities eat to maintain their physiques, this site likely has an entry on it.  

- **CelebrityRoutines.com** – In addition to workouts, the Celebrity Routines site covers other aspects of stars’ health regimens – including diet tips. For example, it might run articles like “Brad Pitt’s Fight Club Diet” or “How [Celebrity] Fuels Their Day.” The **Celebrity Routines** site is more of a news/blog format, but it aggregates plenty of individual cases (recent headlines have featured actors’ fitness *and* nutrition secrets).  

- **Good Routine Club / GotRoutines** – The routines sites from category 2 also often mention diet and nutrition as part of a person’s daily routine. For example, Good Routine Club’s profiles include sections on a person’s diet or supplements (e.g. Huberman’s dietary choices are listed alongside his exercise and sleep routine in the profile). These can be indirect but insightful sources for individual nutrition habits as part of a whole routine.  

- **YouTube “What I Eat in a Day”** – *(Format note: not a website, but a widespread content genre)* Many creators and celebrities share “what I eat in a day” videos. While you have to seek these out by person, some compilation articles and channels group them (for instance, a YouTube channel might compile athletes’ diet videos). Additionally, subreddits like r/Volumeeating or r/nutrition occasionally discuss famous diet protocols. (For a pure website approach, the above options are more direct.)

## 6. **Creator Workflows / Content Creation Setups**  

- **Kit.co (formerly Kit.com)** – A popular platform for creators (YouTubers, streamers, photographers, etc.) to share their gear and software setups. Creators build “kits” listing all the equipment and tools they use for a certain purpose – for example, a “YouTube Filmmaking Kit” might include their camera, lights, microphone, editing software, and so on. Browsing kit.co, you can find profiles of many content creators and see the exact products they use and recommend for content creation.  

- **Creator Gear & Workflow Posts** – Various individual creator blogs and channels sometimes post detailed breakdowns of their process and setups. For instance, bloggers like Ali Abdaal have written about their video production workflow and desk setup, and photographers often blog about their editing workflow and gear. While these aren’t aggregated on one site, you can find them via search (e.g. “My YouTube workflow” or “How I make videos – gear and process”). Some tech YouTube channels also have companion websites or newsletter archives where they share their tool stack for content creation.  

- **Subreddits for Creators** – Communities like r/VideoEditing, r/Filmmakers, or r/YouTubers sometimes have threads where people share their production setups (camera, software, etc.) or discuss their content planning process. For example, an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with a popular YouTuber might reveal their editing rig and scheduling system. These are less organized, but can still yield insight into creators’ personal workflows and tools.  

- **ConvertKit Creator Stories / Indie Creators** – (General mention) Blogs focused on the creator economy, such as ConvertKit’s blog or HackerNoon, occasionally run “behind the scenes” articles on how a creator produces content. They might cover a podcaster’s recording setup or a newsletter author’s writing process. Again, not a dedicated site for workflows, but part of the broader landscape where such information appears.

## 7. **Developer Setups / Dotfiles**  

- **Dotfiles.github.io** – This is a community-curated repository of dotfiles (configuration files) from developers. Essentially, many developers upload their system config (for shell, editor, OS, etc.) to GitHub; dotfiles.github.io aggregates some of the best or most interesting ones as “inspiration.” Browsing this, you find links to dozens of developers’ dotfiles and setup notes, which is a window into their development environment (preferred OS, terminal setup, IDE plugins, and so on). It’s not a pretty UI, but it *is* a catalog of personal dev setups at the config level.  

- **Awesome Dotfiles List** – Relatedly, there’s an “Awesome Dotfiles” GitHub list ([github.com](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles#:~:text=A%20curated%20list%20of%20dotfiles,resources)) that collects resources about managing and discovering dotfiles. It links out to guides and examples of individual configurations. While it’s more of a resource list than profiles, it directs you to many individual developers’ dotfile repositories, effectively cataloging their setups (from keyboard shortcuts to color themes).  

- **Uses Pages / /uses Initiative** – Many developers maintain a `/uses` page on their personal website (inspired by the /uses initiative by Wes Bos and others). These pages are essentially lists of what hardware and software they currently use. There are aggregator sites and lists that gather these (e.g., a repository of “/uses” pages across the web). If you find one developer’s /uses page, it often links to the community or others’ pages. Collectively, it’s a decentralized way of cataloging developer setups – you can find dozens of them by searching “site:uses.tech developer /uses page.”  

- **Reddit – r/unixporn and r/linuxsetups** – On the more visual side, subreddits like r/unixporn showcase screenshots of developers’ customized *nix (Linux/Unix) desktops. Posters typically include details or dotfiles for their Window Manager/terminal setups. There’s also r/linuxsetups or r/macsetups where people describe their computer setup (OS, dev tools, config tweaks). These forums effectively catalog many user setups, albeit in discussion form.  

- **Dev.to and Hacker News Discussions** – Occasionally, dev community sites have threads like “What’s Your Development Setup?” or “Show me your dotfiles.” For example, Dev.to had a “Show off your workspace” thread ([dev.to](https://dev.to/xenoxdev/show-off-your-workspace-5a95#:~:text=Show%20off%20your%20Workspace%20%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8F%BB%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%92%AF,Open%20Forem)) and one can find HN threads where people list their programming setups. These aren’t permanent catalogs, but they surface lots of individual configurations and tool choices in one place.

## 8. **Entrepreneur/Founder Stacks**  

- **Stacklist (stacklist.com)** – A platform created specifically for entrepreneurs to share their company’s tool stack. It launched as a *“recommendation platform for enterprise software tools culled from interviews and surveys with entrepreneurs”* ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/stacklist/#:~:text=Today%2C%20she%E2%80%99s%20launching%20a%20platform,surveys%20with%C2%A0entrepreneurs%20across%20the%20industry)). In practice, Stacklist compiled the software choices of many startup founders (for HR, marketing, development, etc.) so new founders could learn which tools experienced peers recommend. It’s a go-to site for seeing what tools real startups use to run their business.  

- **Starter Story** – A massive collection of founder interviews (focused on how people started and grew various businesses). In each **Starter Story** interview, the founder often mentions the tools and services that power their workflow – from e-commerce platforms and CRMs to design software. They may not always be formatted as a neat list, but with thousands of interviews, StarterStory functions as a broad catalog of entrepreneurs’ tool stacks and processes (you can even search the site for specific tools to see who uses them).  

- **Indie Hackers (interviews section)** – IndieHackers.com hosts interviews and podcasts with entrepreneurs and indie startup founders. Similar to Starter Story, the discussions frequently touch on what tech stack or services the founder used (e.g. “I built my app using X for the frontend, Y for payments, Z for analytics…”). There isn’t a single page listing all the stacks, but reading the interviews gives anecdotal data on many individuals’ setups. Indie Hackers also has forum posts where people share favorite tools for productivity, marketing, etc., effectively crowdsourcing founder stack info.  

- **Product Hunt Collections / Startup Stash** – These aren’t personal profiles, but for completeness: *Product Hunt* sometimes has community-generated collections like “Founder Toolkit” highlighting popular tools among founders. Similarly, *Startup Stash* is a curated directory of tools for startups. While not tied to specific individuals, they’re reflective of what a lot of founders use and can complement the above sites when researching the competitive landscape of tools.

## 9. **“What’s in My Bag” Style Sites (Everyday Carry)**  

- **EverydayCarry.com** – The quintessential everyday carry (EDC) community site. It provides *“an in-depth look into the pockets, professions, and lives of our community”* ([everydaycarry.com](https://everydaycarry.com/about/#:~:text=At%20Everyday%20Carry%20we%20provide,tackle%20unexpected%20emergencies%20in%20stride)) by showcasing user-submitted pocket dumps and bag dumps. Members post a photo of the items they carry daily (knives, wallets, gadgets, notebooks, etc.) along with a list of every item and often explanations. The site categorizes EDC posts by themes (urban, minimalist, tech, etc.) and has been running since 2009, amassing thousands of entries.  

- **Carryology** – A blog and community dedicated to the art of carry (bags, EDC gear, backpacks). Carryology features reviews and releases, but also profiles people’s carry setups in interviews called “What's In Your Bag” or “EDC of the Week.” They often talk to explorers, photographers, or entrepreneurs about what gear is in their bag and why. It’s a bit more niche and storytelling-focused, but it complements the raw item-list approach of EverydayCarry.com with deeper dives into carry philosophy.  

- **Reddit – r/EDC** – The Everyday Carry subreddit is a large community where users regularly share their **bag dumps and pocket dumps** (usually with a photo and list of items). It’s very active with a mix of hobbyists and professionals; one post might be a student’s minimal backpack contents, another a technician’s toolkit bag. Scrolling through r/EDC gives a crowdsourced catalog of hundreds of individuals’ carry setups, and discussions often include why they chose each item.  

- **Shotkit (shotkit.com)** – Focused on photographers, Shotkit is essentially “What’s in my camera bag?” for professional photographers. As the site intro says: *“Shotkit lets you take a peek inside [pro] photographers’ camera bags!”* ([shotkit.com](https://shotkit.com/photographers/#:~:text=INSIDE%20YOUR%20CAMERA%20BAG%20Have,photographer%27s%20name%20into%20the%20search)). Photographers submit their gear lists (camera bodies, lenses, accessories) along with photos and a brief commentary. It’s a great resource to see the equipment setups of well-known wedding photographers, photojournalists, landscape photographers, etc., all in one place.  

- **YouTube & Others** – The “What’s in my bag” concept is popular on YouTube (with creators showing everyday tech backpacks, travel bags, etc.), and on sites like *The Verge* or *GQ* that occasionally do an EDC feature with celebrities. For instance, WIRED’s YouTube series *“What’s In Your Bag?”* has famous people dumping out their bag contents (though this is more entertainment). While these aren’t standalone websites, they are part of the broader ecosystem of content cataloging personal gear.

## 10. **Interview-Based “How I Work” Content**  

- **Lifehacker’s “How I Work” Series** – One of the most famous recurring interview series about personal work habits and setups. Since 2012, Lifehacker has run weekly “How I Work” interviews, asking notable people (startup CEOs, authors, developers, etc.) about their productivity secrets, favorite apps and tools, workspace setup, and routines ([www.digitaldiscovery.sg](https://www.digitaldiscovery.sg/blog/productivity-secrets-famous-experts/#:~:text=Since%20mid,interview%20series%20called%C2%A0%E2%80%9CHow%20I%20Work%E2%80%9D)). There’s no single index on Lifehacker, but there are nearly 200 interviews in this series. Many aggregated lists and Medium posts exist that catalog these interviews, given their popularity. This series is basically a playbook of how different successful people get things done.  

- **The Cut’s “How I Get It Done”** – New York Magazine’s The Cut has a similar interview franchise, often featuring women leaders in various fields. Each “How I Get It Done” Q&A covers the subject’s schedule, work hacks, work-life balance, and often tools they rely on. It’s more narrative, but across the archive you’ll find many individuals candidly detailing their day and methods.  

- **NY Times “Sunday Routine”** – The New York Times publishes a weekly column in its Metro section called *Sunday Routine* that profiles how a notable New Yorker spends their Sunday. It’s a slice-of-life that often includes their morning activities, leisure, family time, preparations for Monday, and favorite gadgets or spots. Over years, this column has essentially cataloged the diverse Sunday habits of hundreds of people (from celebrities to local business owners).  

- **Fast Company, Inc., Forbes (productivity interviews)** – Various business outlets run their own versions of these interviews. *Inc.* has featured “A Day in the Life” of entrepreneurs; *Forbes* and *Fast Company* often ask CEOs about their daily schedule or tools. For example, Fast Company had a series where they ask leaders about the apps they can’t live without. These articles are scattered, but collectively serve as a rich source of individual workflow insights.  

- **Podcast Transcripts & Newsletters** – As a final note, many productivity or tech podcasts (e.g. *Back to Work*, *HBR IdeaCast*) and newsletters (like *Morning Brew’s Sidekick* or *Maker Mind*) include interviews or spotlights on how a person works. The formats vary – some focus on routines, others on tools – but if archived on a website, they contribute to this landscape. For instance, *Hacker Noon* and *Medium* have user-submitted interviews that sometimes mirror the “how I work” style. When doing SEO research, these can be sources to mine for keywords and concepts, even if they aren’t solely dedicated sites.

Each of these sites (or communities) offers a window into how individuals organize their work and life – whether through the tech tools they use, the habits they practice, or the objects they carry. Together, they form an exhaustive map for research into personal systems and setups across various domains.
