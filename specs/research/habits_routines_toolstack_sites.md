**HustlersHQ (hustlershq.io)** – This site profiles the daily routines of successful, influential people (entrepreneurs, authors, etc.), showing how they structure their day from morning to night ([hustlershq.io](https://hustlershq.io/routines#:~:text=Discover%20the%20daily%20routines%20of,successful%2C%20influential%20and%20interesting%20people)). Each profile breaks down an individual’s schedule and habits, similar to Routines.club’s approach for notable figures’ rituals.  

**Uses This (usesthis.com)** – Also known as *The Setup*, it’s a long-running collection of interviews asking people from all walks of life *“what they use to get the job done.”* The site catalogs the hardware, software, and tools that writers, developers, designers, and others use in their work and daily routines ([usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com/#:~:text=Enjoying%20the%20interviews%3F%20Support%20independent,they%20use%20to%20get%20the)). It’s a great example of listing personal “tool stacks” in interview format.  

**Lifehacker’s “How I Work” series** –  Tech blog *Lifehacker* has an ongoing weekly series called **How I Work**, which features interviews with notable professionals about their work habits, productivity routines, favorite gadgets, and tools. Over the years they’ve compiled almost 200 of these profiles ([debbiediscovers.medium.com](https://debbiediscovers.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-lifehackers-how-i-work-series-3cc6b4265b8e#:~:text=Sitemap%20Open%20in%20app%20Sign,%E2%80%9CHow%20I%20Work%E2%80%9D%20Interviews%20with)), making it a rich archive of individual routines and toolkits. This series is a good model for SEO-friendly content since each post targets a person’s name plus keywords like “workflow” or “productivity tips.”  

**MyMorningRoutine.com** – This site (now an archive and a published book) collected detailed Q&A interviews about people’s morning routines and habits. For over six years it published a new morning routine every week, building an *“ever-expanding collection of questions and answers from inspiring individuals”* worldwide ([mymorningroutine.com](https://mymorningroutine.com/questions-answers/#:~:text=Publishing%20a%20brand%20new%20morning,living%20all%20over%20the%20world)). Browsing these profiles can show how to present personal habit data in a consistent, SEO-optimized format (targeting queries like “morning routine of [Person]”).  

**Mason Currey’s Daily Routines (Daily Rituals)** – An earlier example of cataloging routines is Mason Currey’s *Daily Routines* blog (later expanded into the book *Daily Rituals*). This project described the workday schedules and ritualistic habits of dozens of famous artists, writers, and thinkers, past and present ([www.openculture.com](https://www.openculture.com/2015/01/the-daily-routines-of-famous-creative-people-presented-in-an-interactive-infographic.html#:~:text=easy%20to%20think%20that%20the,how%20they%20struc%C2%ADture%20their%20day)). It’s not a conventional modern website layout, but as content it serves a similar purpose – attracting readers interested in how accomplished individuals organize their day. Each profile can inspire SEO keywords around “[Name] daily schedule” or “[Name] habits.”
