### Current Implementation

Latest preview URL: [http://localhost:4321/playbooks/automated-gifting-system/]

### Notes

- The current implementation (`src/pages/playbooks/[slug].astro`), alongside the JSON schema which populates the page, does include some elements which are desirable but _absent_ from the conceptual mockup (`docs/playbook_page_mockup.png`), which focused more on aesthetics and was made _prior_ to the finalization of the playbook data model & schema
- We may need to create more components or create final designs for components which were YOLO'd with code in the existing page but not present in the illustrative mockup
- There are many desirable components which assist with communicating the narrative, value, tactics, and key moments of the playbook which were _neither_ in the illustrative mockup _nor_ in the current implementation; we may need to update our prompting or schema to facilitate the usage of these components; these include amongst other things, quotes, messages, emails, calendar items, and so on in `src/components/`

#### In current implementation but NOT in mockup, i.e. "needs design":

- BeforeAfter transformation cards
- SectionSpecs tables
- SectionChecklist with substeps
- FAQ accordion
- References section

#### In mockup but NOT yet fully implemented, i.e. "needs Astro component" or "needs implementation in template page":

- Custom watercolor hero illustrations
- Author/profile cards
- Flowchart/process diagrams (FlowDiagram component exists but not wired to generated playbooks)
- Vertical dividers framing editorial text
- "More Playbooks" discovery section with cards

#### Rich embed components available but unused, i.e. "needs update to prompt/schema/other" (and possibly guidance on how to include these from both a design and content standpoint):

- Messages.astro - WhatsApp/iMessage/ChatGPT conversations
- Calendar.astro - Google/Apple/Outlook views
- EmailThread.astro - Gmail-style threads
- Notifications.astro - macOS/iOS/Android alerts
- DataTableViewer.astro - Sheets/Notion/Airtable tables
- SocialQuote.astro - Twitter/LinkedIn/Podcast quotes
